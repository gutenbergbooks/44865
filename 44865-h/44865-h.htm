THE SECRET SERVICE.</h2>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</h3>

<div class="chapquot">
   <div>
      <p>I will go on the slightest errand now to the antipodes
      that you can desire to send me on.</p>
      <p class="citation">Much Ado about Nothing.</p>
   </div>
</div>

<p>Early in 1861, I felt a strong desire to look at the Secession
movement for myself; to learn, by personal observation, whether it
sprang from the people or not; what the Revolutionists wanted, what
they hoped, and what they feared.</p>

<p>But the southern climate, never propitious to the longevity of
Abolitionists, was now unfavorable to the health of every northerner,
no matter how strong his political constitution. I felt the danger of
being recognized; for several years of roving journalism, and a good
deal of political speaking on the frontier, had made my face familiar
to persons whom I did not remember at all, and given me that large
and motley acquaintance which every half-public life necessitates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>Moreover, I had passed through the Kansas struggle; and many
former shining lights of Border Ruffianism were now, with perfect
fitness, lurid torches in the early bonfires of Secession. I did not
care to meet their eyes, for I could not remember a single man of
them all who would be likely to love me, either wisely or too well.
But the newspaper instinct was strong within me, and the journalist
who deliberates is lost. My hesitancy resulted in writing for a
roving commission to represent <span class="smcap">The Tribune</span>
in the Southwest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Managing Editor.</div>

<p>A few days after, I found the Managing Editor in his office, going
through the great pile of letters the morning mail had brought him,
with the wonderful rapidity which quick intuition, long experience,
and natural fitness for that most delicate and onerous position
alone can give. For the modern newspaper is a sort of intellectual
iron-clad, upon which, while the Editorial Captain makes out the
reports to his chief, the public, and entertains the guests in his
elegant cabin, the leading column, and receives the credit for every
broadside of type and every paper bullet of the brain poured into
the enemy,&mdash;back out of sight is an Executive Officer, with little
popular fame, who keeps the ship all right from hold to maintop,
looks to every detail with sleepless vigilance, and whose life is a
daily miracle of hard work.</p>

<p>The Manager went through his mail, I think, at the rate of one letter
per minute. He made final disposition of each when it came into his
hand; acting upon the great truth, that if he laid one aside for
future consideration, there would soon be a series of strata upon his
groaning desk, which no mental geologist could fathom or classify.
Some were ruthlessly thrown into the waste-basket. Others, with a
lightning pencil-stroke, to indicate the type and style of printing,
were placed on the pile for the composing-room. A few great packages
of manuscript were re-enclosed in envelopes for the mail, with a
three-line note, which, while I did not read, I knew must run like
this:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>&mdash;Your article has unquestionable
merit; but by the imperative pressure of important news
upon our columns, we are very reluctantly compelled," etc.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">Preliminary Instructions.</div>

<p>There was that quick, educated instinct, which reads the whole from
a very small part, taking in a line here and a key-word there. Two
or three glances appeared to decide the fate of each; yet the reader
was not wholly absorbed, for all the while he kept up a running
conversation:</p>

<p>"I received your letter. Are you going to New Orleans?"</p>

<p>"Not unless you send me."</p>

<p>"I suppose you know it is rather precarious business?"</p>

<p>"O, yes."</p>

<p>"Two of our correspondents have come home within the last week, after
narrow escapes. We have six still in the South; and it would not
surprise me, this very hour, to receive a telegram announcing the
imprisonment or death of any one of them."</p>

<p>"I have thought about all that, and decided."</p>

<p>"Then we shall be very glad to have you go."</p>

<p>"When may I start?"</p>

<p>"To-day, if you like."</p>

<p>"What field shall I occupy?"</p>

<p>"As large a one as you please. Go and remain just where you think
best."</p>

<p>"How long shall I stay?"</p>

<p>"While the excitement lasts, if possible. Do you know how long you
<em>will</em> stay? You will be back here some fine morning in just about
two weeks."</p>

<p>"Wait and see."</p>

<p>Pondering upon the line of conduct best for the journey, I
remembered the injunction of the immortal

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Pickwick: "It is always best on these
occasions to do what the mob do!" "But," suggested Mr. Snodgrass,
"suppose there are two mobs?" "<em>Shout with the largest</em>," replied Mr.
Pickwick. Volumes could not say more. Upon this plan I determined
to act&mdash;concealing my occupation, political views, and place of
residence. It is not pleasant to wear a padlock upon one's tongue,
for weeks, nor to adopt a course of systematic duplicity; but
personal convenience and safety rendered it an inexorable necessity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Ride Through Kentucky.</div>

<p>On Tuesday, February 26th, I left Louisville, Kentucky, by the
Nashville train. Public affairs were the only topic of conversation
among the passengers. They were about equally divided into
enthusiastic Secessionists, urging in favor of the new movement that
negroes already commanded higher prices than ever before; and quasi
Loyalists, reiterating, "We only want Kentucky to remain in the
Union as long as she can do so honorably." Not a single man declared
himself unqualifiedly for the Government.</p>

<p>A ride of five hours among blue, dreamy hills, feathered with timber;
dense forests, with their drooping foliage and log dwellings, in the
doors of which women and little girls were complacently smoking their
pipes; great, hospitable farm-houses, in the midst of superb natural
parks; tobacco plantations, upon which negroes of both sexes&mdash;the
women in cowhide brogans, and faded frocks, with gaudy kerchiefs
wrapped like turbans about their heads&mdash;were hoeing, and following
the plow, brought us to Cave City.</p>

<p>I left the train for a stage-ride of ten miles to the Mammoth
Cave Hotel. In the midst of a smooth lawn, shaded by stately oaks
and slender pines, it looms up huge and white, with a long, low,
one-story offshoot

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
 fronted by a deep portico, and known as "the
Cottages."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Curiosities of White's Cave.</div>

<p>Several evening hours were spent pleasantly in White's Cave, where
the formations, at first dull and leaden, turn to spotless white
after one grows accustomed to the dim light of the torches. There are
little lakes so utterly transparent that your eye fails to detect
the presence of water; stone drapery, hanging in graceful folds, and
forming an exquisitely beautiful chamber; petrified fountains, where
the water still trickles down and hardens into stone; a honey-combed
roof, which is a very perfect counterfeit of art; long rows of
stalactites, symmetrically ribbed and fluted, which stretch off in a
pleasing colonnade, and other rare specimens of Nature's handiwork
in her fantastic moods. Many of them are vast in dimension, though
the geologists declare that it requires <em>thirty</em> years to deposit a
formation no thicker than a wafer! Well says the German proverb "God
is patient because he is eternal."</p>

<p>With another visitor I passed the next day in the Mammoth Cave.
"Mat," our sable cicerone, had been acting in the capacity of guide
for twenty-five years, and it was estimated that he had walked
more than fifty thousand miles under ground. The story is not so
improbable when one remembers that the passages of the great cavern
are, in the aggregate, upwards of one hundred and fifty miles in
length, and that it has two hundred and twenty-six known chambers.
The outfit consisted of two lamps for himself and one for each of us.
Cans of oil are kept at several interior points; for it is of the

<div class="sidenote">The Mammoth Cave.&mdash;Lung Complaints.</div>

<p>The thermometer within stands constantly at fifty-nine Fahrenheit;
and the cave "breathes just once a year." Through the winter it takes
one long inspiration, and in summer the air rushes steadily outward.
Its vast chambers are the lungs of the universe.</p>

<p>In 1845, a number of wood and stone cottages were erected in the
cavern, and inhabited by consumptive patients, who believed that the
dry atmosphere and equable temperature would prove beneficial. After
three or four months their faces were bloodless; the pupils of their
sunken eyes dilated until the iris became invisible and the organs
appeared black, no matter what their original color. Three patients
died in the cave; the others expired soon after leaving it.</p>

<p>Mat gave a vivid description of these invalids flitting about like
ghosts&mdash;their hollow coughs echoing and reechoing through the
cavernous chambers. It must have looked horrible&mdash;as if the tomb had
oped its ponderous and marble jaws, that its victims might wander
about in this subterranean Purgatory. A cemetery would seem cheerful
in comparison with such a living entombment. Volunteer medical
advice, like a motion to adjourn, is always in order. My own panacea
for lung-complaints would be exactly the opposite. Mount a horse or
take a carriage, and ride, by easy stages at first, across the great
plains to the Rocky Mountains or California, eating and sleeping in
the open air. Nature is very kind, if you will trust her fully; and
in the atmosphere, which is so dry and pure that fresh meat, cut in
strips and hung up, will cure without salting or smoking, and may be
carried all over the world, her healing power seems almost boundless.</p>

<p>The walls and roof of the cave were darkened and often hidden by
myriads of screeching bats, at this

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
season of the year all hanging
torpid by the claws, with heads downward, and unable to fly away,
even when subjected to the cruel experiment of being touched by the
torches.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <span class="smcap">Methodist Church.&mdash;Fat Man's Misery.</span>
</div>

<p>The Methodist Church is a semi-circular chamber, in which a ledge
forms the natural pulpit; and logs, brought in when religious service
was first performed, fifty years ago, in perfect preservation, yet
serve for seats. Methodist itinerants and other clergymen still
preach at long intervals. Worship, conducted by the "dim religious
light" of tapers, and accompanied by the effect which music always
produces in subterranean halls, must be peculiarly impressive. It
suggests those early days in the Christian Church, when the hunted
followers of Jesus met at midnight in mountain caverns, to blend in
song their reverent voices; to hear anew the strange, sweet story of
his teachings, his death, and his all-embracing love.</p>

<p>Upon one of the walls beyond, a figure of gypsum, in bass-relief, is
called the American Eagle. The venerable bird, in consonance with
the evil times upon which he had fallen, was in a sadly ragged and
dilapidated condition. One leg and other portions of his body had
seceded, leaving him in seeming doubt as to his own identity; but the
beak was still perfect, as if he could send forth upon occasion his
ancient notes of self-gratulation.</p>

<p>Minerva's Dome has fluted walls, and a concave roof, beautifully
honey-combed; but no statue of its mistress. The oft-invoked goddess,
wearied by the merciless orators who are always compelling her to
leap anew from the brain of Jove, has doubtless, in some hidden nook,
found seclusion and repose.</p>

<p>We toiled along the narrow, tortuous passage, chiseled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
through the
rock by some ancient stream of water, and appropriately named the
Fat Man's Misery; wiped away the perspiration in the ample passage
beyond, known as the Great Relief; glanced inside the Bacon Chamber,
where the little masses of lime-rock pendent from the roof do look
marvelously like esculent hams; peeped down into the cylindrical
Bottomless Pit, which the reader shall be told, confidentially, <em>has</em>
a bottom just one hundred and sixty feet below the surface; laughed
at the roof-figures of the Giant, his Wife, and Child, which resemble
a caricature from Punch; admired the delicate, exquisite flowers of
white, fibrous gypsum, along the walls of Pensacola Avenue; stood
beside the Dead Sea, a dark, gloomy body of water; crossed the Styx
by the natural bridge which spans it, and halted upon the shore of
Lethe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Ride Down the Lethe.</div>

<p>Then, embarking in a little flat-boat, we slowly glided along the
river of Oblivion. It was a strange, weird spectacle. The flickering
torches dimly revealed the dark inclosing walls, which rise abruptly
a hundred feet to the black roof. Our sable guide looked, in the
ghastly light, like a recent importation from Pluto's domain; and
stood in the bows, steering the little craft, which moved slowly down
the winding, sluggish river. The deep silence was only broken by
drops of water, which fell from the roof, striking the stream like
the tick of a clock, and the sharp <em>ylp</em> of the paddle, as it was
thrust into the wave to guide us. When my companion evoked from his
flute strains of slow music, which resounded in hollow echoes through
the long vault, it grew so demoniac, that I almost expected the walls
to open and reveal a party of fiends, dancing to infernal music
around a lurid fire. I never saw any stage effect or work of art that
could compare with it.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
 If one would enjoy the most vivid sensations
of the grand and gloomy, let him float down Lethe to the sound of a
dirge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <span class="smcap">The Star Chamber.&mdash;Mag&shy;nifi&shy;cent
   Distances.</span>
</div>

<p>We first saw the Star Chamber with the lights withdrawn. It revealed
to us the meaning of "darkness visible." We seemed to <em>feel</em> the
dense blackness against our eye-balls. An object within half an
inch of them was not in the faintest degree perceptible. If one
were left alone here, reason could not long sustain itself. Even
a few hours, in the absence of light, would probably shake it. In
numberless little spots, the dark gypsum has scaled off, laying bare
minute sections of the white limestone roof, resembling stars. When
the chamber was lighted the illusion became perfect. We seemed in a
deep, rock-walled pit, gazing up at the starry firmament. The torch,
slowly moved to throw a shadow along the roof, produced the effect
of a cloud sailing over the sky; but the scene required no such aid
to render it one of marvelous beauty. The Star Chamber is the most
striking picture in all this great gallery of Nature.</p>

<p>My companion had spent his whole life within a few miles of the
cave, but now visited it for the first time. Thus it is always;
objects which pilgrims come half across the world to see, we regard
with indifference at our own doors. Persons have passed all their
days in sight of Mount Washington, and yet never looked upon the
grand panorama from its brow. Men have lived from childhood almost
within sound of the roar of Niagara, without ever gazing on the vast
fountain, where mother Earth, like Rachel, weeps for her children,
and will not be comforted. We appreciate no enjoyment justly, until
we see it through the charmed medium of magnificent distances. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Political Feeling in Kentucky.</div>

<p>Throughout Kentucky the pending troubles were uppermost in every
heart and on every tongue. One gentleman, in conversation, thus
epitomized the feeling of the State:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We have more wrongs to complain of than any other slave community,
for Kentucky loses more negroes than all the cotton States combined.
But Secession is no remedy. It would be jumping out of the frying-pan
into the fire."</p>

<p>Another, whose head was silvered with age, said to me:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When I was a boy here in this county, some of our neighbors
started for New Orleans on a flat-boat. As we bade them good-by,
we never expected to see them again; we thought they were going
out of the world. But, after several months, they returned, having
come on foot all the way, through the Indian country, packing
<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1"
class="fnanchor">1</a> their blankets and provisions. Now we come
from New Orleans in five days. I thank God to have lived in this
age&mdash;the age of the Railroad, the Telegraph, and the Printing
Press. Ours was the greatest nation and the greatest era in history.
But that is all past now. The Government is broken to pieces; the
slave States can not obtain their rights; and those which have
seceded will never come back."</p>

<p>An old farmer "reckoned," as I traveled a good deal, that I might
know better than he whether there was any hope of a peaceable
settlement. If the North, as he believed, was willing to be just, an
overwhelming majority of Kentuckians would stand by the Union. "It
is a great pity," he said, very earnestly, in a broken voice, "that
we Americans could not live harmoniously, like

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
brethren, instead of
always quarreling about a few niggers."</p>

<p>My recollections of Nashville, Tennessee, include only an unpalatable
breakfast in one of its abominable hotels; a glimpse at some of its
pleasant shaded streets and marble capitol, which, with the exception
of that in Columbus, Ohio, is considered the finest State-house on
the continent.</p>

<p>Continuing southward, I found the country already "appareled in the
sweet livery of spring." The elm and gum trees wore their leafy
glory; the grass and wheat carpeted the ground with swelling verdure,
and field and forest glowed with the glossy green of the holly. The
railway led through large cotton-fields, where many negroes, of both
sexes, were plowing and hoeing, while overseers sat upon the high,
zig-zag fences, armed with rifles or shot-guns. On the withered
stalks snowy tufts of cotton were still protruding from the dull
brown bolls&mdash;portions of the last year's crop, which had never been
picked, and were disappearing under the plow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <span class="smcap">Cotton-Fields.&mdash;An Indignant Alabamian.</span>
</div>

<p>A native Kentuckian, now a young merchant in Alabama, was one of
my fellow-passengers. He pronounced the people aristocratic. They
looked down upon every man who worked for his living&mdash;indeed, upon
every one who did not own negroes. The ladies were pretty, and often
accomplished, but, he mildly added, he would like them better if they
did not "dip." He insisted that Alabama had been precipitated into
the revolution.</p>

<p>"We were <em>swindled</em> out of our rights. In my own town,
Jere Clemens&mdash;an ex-United States senator, and one of the
ablest men in the State&mdash;was elected to the convention on the
strongest public pledges of Unionism. When the convention met, he
went completely over to the enemy. The leaders&mdash;a few heavy
slaveholders,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
aided by political demagogues&mdash;dared not submit the Secession
ordinance to a popular vote; they knew the people would defeat
them. They are determined on war; they will exasperate the ignorant
masses to the last degree before they allow them to vote on any test
question. I trust the Government will put them down by force of arms,
no matter what the cost!"</p>

<p>The same evening, crossing the Alabama line, I was in the
"Confederate States of America." At the little town of Athens, the
Stars and Stripes were still floating; as the train left, I cast a
longing look at the old flag, wondering when I should see it again.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <span class="smcap">"Our Cor&shy;res&shy;pon&shy;dent" as a New Mexican.</span>
</div>

<p>The next person who took a seat beside me went through the formula
of questions, usual between strangers in the South and the Far
West, asking my name, residence, business, and destination. He was
informed, in reply, that I lived in the Territory of New Mexico, and
was now traveling leisurely to New Orleans, designing to visit Vera
Cruz and the City of Mexico before returning home. This hypothesis,
to which I afterward adhered, was rendered plausible by my knowledge
of New Mexico, and gave me the advantage of not being deemed a
partisan. Secessionists and Unionists alike, regarding me as a
stranger with no particular sympathies, conversed freely. Aaron Burr
asserts that "a lie well stuck to is good as the truth;" in my own
case, it was decidedly better than the truth.</p>

<p>My querist was a cattle-drover, who spent most of his time in
traveling through Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. He declared
emphatically that the people of those States had been placed in a
false position; that their hearts were loyal to the Union, in spite
of all the arts which had been used to deceive and exasperate them.</p>

<p>At Memphis was an old friend, whom I had not met
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
for many years,
and who was now commercial editor of the leading Secession journal.
I knew him to be perfectly trustworthy, and, at heart, a bitter
opponent of Slavery. On the morning of my arrival, he called upon
me at the Gayoso House. After his first cordial greeting, he asked,
abruptly:</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Hot Climate for Abolitionists.</div>

<p>"What are you doing down here?"</p>

<p>"Corresponding for <cite>The Tribune</cite>."</p>

<p>"How far are you going?"</p>

<p>"Through all the Gulf States, if possible."</p>

<p>"My friend," said he, in his deep bass tones, "do you know that you
are on very perilous business?<del>'</del><ins>"</ins></p>

<p>"Possibly; but I shall be extremely prudent when I get into a hot
climate."</p>

<p>"I do not know" (with a shrug of the shoulders) "what you call
a hot climate. Last week, two northerners, who had been mobbed as
Abolitionists, passed through here, with their heads shaved, going
home, in charge of the Adams' Express. A few days before, a man was
hung on that cottonwood tree which you see just across the river,
upon the charge of tampering with slaves. Another person has just
been driven out of the city, on suspicion of writing a letter for
<cite>The Tribune</cite>. If the people in this house, and out on the
street in front, knew you to be one of its correspondents, they would
not leave you many minutes for saying your prayers."</p>

<p>After a long, minute conversation, in which my friend learned my
plans and gave me some valuable hints, he remarked:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aims and Animus of Secessionists.</div>

<p>"My first impulse was to go down on my knees, and beg you, for God's
sake, to turn back; but I rather think you may go on with comparative
safety. You are the first man to whom I have opened my heart for
years.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
I wish some of my old northern friends, who think Slavery a
good thing, could witness the scenes in the slave auctions, which
have so often made my blood run cold. I knew two runaway negroes
absolutely starve themselves to death in their hiding-places in
this city, rather than make themselves known, and be sent back to
their masters. I disliked Slavery before; now I hate it, down to the
very bottom of my heart." His compressed lips and clinched fingers,
driving their nails into his palms, attested the depth of his feeling.</p>

</div>

<p>While I remained in Memphis, my friend, who was brought into
familiar contact with leading Secessionists, gave me much valuable
information. He insisted that they were in the minority, but
carried the day because they were noisy and aggressive, overawing
the Loyalists, who staid quietly at home. Before the recent city
election, every one believed the Secessionists in a large majority;
but, when a Union meeting was called, the people turned out
surprisingly, and, as they saw the old flag, gave cheer after cheer,
"with tears in their voices." Many, intimidated, staid away from the
polls. The newspapers of the city, with a single exception, were
disloyal, but the Union ticket was elected by a majority of more than
three hundred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Secession Aims and Grievances.</div>

<p>"Tell me exactly what the 'wrongs' and 'grievances' are, of which I
hear so much on every side."</p>

<p>"It is difficult to answer. The masses have been stirred into a
vague, bitter, 'soreheaded' feeling that the South is wronged; but
the leaders seldom descend to particulars. When they do, it is
very ludicrous. They urge the marvelous growth of the North; the
abrogation of the Missouri Compromise (done by southern votes!),
and that Freedom has always distanced Slavery in the territories.
Secession is no new or spontaneous uprising; every one of its
leaders here has talked of it and planned it for years. Individual
ambition, and wild dreams of a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
great southern empire, which shall
include Mexico, Central America, and Cuba, seem to be their leading
incentives. But there is another, stronger still. You can hardly
imagine how bitterly they hate the Democratic Idea&mdash;how they loathe
the thought that the vote of any laboring man, with a rusty coat
and soiled hands, may neutralize that of a wealthy, educated,
slave-owning gentleman."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spring-Time in Memphis.</div>

<p>Thus Charles Mackay describes Memphis; but it impressed me as the
pleasantest city of the South. Though its population was only thirty
thousand, it had the air and promise of a great metropolis. The long
steamboat landing was so completely covered with cotton that drays
and carriages could hardly thread the few tortuous passages leading
down to the water's edge. Bales of the same great staple were piled
up to the ceiling in the roomy stores of the cotton factors; the
hotels were crowded, and spacious and elegant blocks were being
erected.</p>

<p>A few days earlier, in Cleveland, I had seen the ground covered with
snow; but here I was in the midst of early summer. During the first
week of March, the heat was so oppressive that umbrellas and fans
were in general use upon the streets. The broad, shining leaves of
the magnolia, and the delicate foliage of the weeping willow, were
nodding adieu to winter; the air was sweet with cherry blossoms; with</p>

<div class="sidenote">Captain McIntire, late of the Army.</div>

<p>On the evening of March 3d I left Memphis. A thin-visaged,
sandy-haired, angular gentleman in spectacles, who occupied a
car-seat near me, though of northern birth, had resided in the
Gulf States for several years, as agent for an Albany manufactory
of cotton-gins and agricultural implements. A broad-shouldered,
roughly dressed, sun-browned young man, whose chin was hidden by a
small forest of beard, accepted the proffer of a cigar, took a seat
beside us, and introduced himself as Captain McIntire, of the United
States Army, who had just resigned his commission, on account of the
pending troubles, and was returning from the Texian frontier to his
plantation in Mississippi. He was the first bitter Secessionist I had
met, and I listened with attent ear to his complaints of northern
aggression.</p>

<p>The Albanian was an advocate of Slavery and declared that, in the
event of separation, his lot was with the South, for better or for
worse; but he mildly urged that the Secession movement was hasty and
ill advised; hoped the difficulty might be settled by compromise,
and declared that, traveling through all the cotton States since
Mr. Lincoln's election, he had found, everywhere outside the great
cities, a strong love for the Union and a universal hope that the
Republic might continue indivisible. He was very "conservative;" had
always voted the Democratic ticket; was confident the northern people
would not willingly wrong their southern brethren; and insisted that
not more than twenty or thirty thousand persons in the State of
New-York were, in any just sense, Abolitionists.</p>

<p>Captain McIntire silently heard him through, and then remarked:</p>

<p>"You seem to be a gentleman; you may be sincere in your opinions;
but it won't do for you to express such

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
sentiments in the State of
Mississippi. They will involve you in trouble and in danger!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">An Amusing Colloquy.</div>

<p>The New-Yorker was swift to explain that he was very "sound,"
favoring no compromise which would not give the slaveholders all they
asked. Meanwhile, a taciturn but edified listener, I pondered upon
the German proverb, that "speech is silver, while silence is golden."
Something gave me a dim suspicion that our violent fire-eater was not
of southern birth; and, after being plied industriously with indirect
questions, he was reluctantly forced to acknowledge himself a native
of the State of New Jersey. Soon after, at a little station, Captain
McIntire, late of the Army of the United States, bade us adieu.</p>

<p>At Grand Junction, after I had assumed a recumbent position in
the sleeping-car, two young women in a neighboring seat fell into
conversation with a gentleman near them, when a droll colloquy
ensued. Learning that he was a New Orleans merchant, one of them
asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you know Mr. Powers, of New Orleans?"</p>

<p>"Powers&mdash;Powers," said the merchant; "what does he do?"</p>

<p>"Gambles," was the cool response.</p>

<p>"Bless me, no! What do you know about a gambler?"</p>

<p>"He is my husband," replied the woman, with ingenuous promptness.</p>

<p>"Your husband a gambler!" ejaculated the gentleman, with horror in
every tone.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," reiterated the undaunted female; "and gamblers are the
best men in the world."</p>

<p>"I didn't know they ever married. I should like to see a gambler's
wife." </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, sir, take a mighty good look, and you can see one now."</p>

<p>The merchant opened the curtains into their compartment, and
scrutinized the speaker&mdash;a young, rosy, and rather comely woman, with
blue eyes and brown hair, quietly and tastefully dressed.</p>

<p>"I should like to know your husband, madam."</p>

<p>"Well, sir; if you've got plenty of money, he will be glad to make
<em>your</em> acquaintance."</p>

<p>"Does he ever go home?"</p>

<p>"Lord bless you, yes! He always comes home at one o'clock in the
morning, after he gets through dealing faro. He has not missed a
single night since we were married&mdash;going on five years. We own a
farm in this vicinity, and if business continues good with him next
year we shall retire to it, and never live in the city again."</p>

<p>All the following day I journeyed through deep forests of heavy
drooping foliage, with pendent tufts of gray Spanish moss. The
beautiful Cherokee rose everywhere trailed its long arms of vivid
green; all the woods were decked with the yellow flowers of the
sassafras and the white blossoms of the dogwood and the wild plum.
Our road stretched out in long perspective through great Louisiana
everglades, where the grass was four feet in hight and the water ten
or twelve inches deep.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Feeling Toward President Lincoln.</div>

<p>"I have wagered a new hat that neither he nor Hamlin will ever live

<div class="sidenote">
   <span class="smcap">What a Mississippi Slaveholder Thought.</span>
</div>

<p>An old Mississippian, a working man, though the owner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
of a dozen
slaves, assured me earnestly that the people did not desire war; but
the North had cheated them in every compromise, and they were bound
to regain their rights, even if they had to fight for them.</p>

<p>"We of the South," said he, "are the most independent people in the
universe. We raise every thing we need; but the world can not do
without cotton. If we have war, it will cause terrible suffering
in the North. I pity the ignorant people of the manufacturing
districts there, who have been deluded by the politicians; for they
will be forced to endure many hardships, and perhaps starvation.
After Southern trade is withdrawn, manufactures stopped, operatives
starving, grass growing in the streets of New York, and crowds
marching up Broadway crying 'Bread or Blood!' northern fanatics will
see, too late, the results of their folly."</p>

<p>This was the uniform talk of Secessionists. That Cotton was not
merely King, but absolute despot; that they could coerce the North
by refusing to buy goods, and coerce the whole world by refusing to
sell cotton, was their profound belief. This was always a favorite
southern theory. Bancroft relates that as early as 1661, the colony
of Virginia, suffering under commercial oppression, urged North
Carolina and Maryland to join her for a year in refusing to raise
tobacco, that they might compel Great Britain to grant certain
desired privileges. Now the Rebels had no suspicion whatever that
there was reciprocity in trade; that they needed to sell their great
staple just as much as the world needed to buy it; that the South
bought goods in New York simply because it was the cheapest and best
market; that, were all the cotton-producing States instantly sunk
in the ocean, in less than five years the world

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
would obtain their
staple, or some adequate substitute, from other sources, and forget
they ever existed.</p>

   <span class="smcap">Wisconsin Freemen vs. Southern Slaves.</span>
</div>

<p>"I spent six weeks last summer," said another planter, "in
Wisconsin. It is a hot-bed of Abolitionism. The working-classes are
astonishingly ignorant. They are honest and industrious, but they are
not so intelligent as the nig-roes of the South. They suppose, if war
comes, we shall have trouble with our slaves. That is utterly absurd.
All my nig-roes would fight for me."</p>

<p>A Mississippian, whom his companions addressed as "Judge," denounced
the Secession movement as a dream of noisy demagogues:</p>

<p>"Their whole policy has been one of precipitation. They declared:
'Let us rush the State out of the Union while Buchanan is President,
and there will be no war.' From the outset, they have acted in
defiance of the sober will of the masses; they have not dared to
submit one of their acts to a popular vote!"</p>

<p>Another passenger, who concurred in these views, and intimated that
he was a Union man, still imputed the troubles mainly to agitation of
the Slavery question.</p>

<p>"The northern people," said he, "have been grossly deceived by their
politicians, newspapers, and books like 'Uncle Tom's Cabin,' whose
very first chapter describes a slave imprisoned and nearly starved to
death in a cellar in New Orleans, when there is not a single cellar
in the whole city!"</p>

<p>Midnight found us at the St. Charles Hotel, a five-story edifice,
with granite basement and walls of stucco&mdash;that be-all and end-all
of New Orleans architecture. The house has an imposing Corinthian
portico, and in the

<div class="sidenote">Hospitality of a Stranger.</div>

<p>"You can not fail to like New Orleans," said a friend, before I left
the North. "Its people are much more genial and cordial to strangers
than ours." I took no letters of introduction, for introduction was
just the thing I did not want. But on the cars, before reaching the
city, I met a gentleman with whom I had a little conversation, and
exchanged the ordinary civilities of traveling. When we parted, he
handed me his card, saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"You are a stranger in New Orleans, and may desire some
information or assistance. Call and see me, and command me,
if I can be of service to you."</p></div>

<p>He proved to be the senior member of one of the heaviest wholesale
houses in the city. Accepting the invitation, I found him in his
counting-room, deeply engrossed in business; but he received me with
great kindness, and gave me information about the leading features of
the city which I wished to see. As I left, he promised to call on me,
adding: "Come in often. By the way, to-morrow is Sunday; why can't
you go home and take a quiet family dinner with me?"</p>

<p>I was curious to learn the social position of one who would invite
a stranger, totally without indorsement, into his home-circle. The
next day he called, and we took a two-story car of the Baronne street
railway. It leads through the Fourth or Lafayette District&mdash;more like
a garden than a city&mdash;containing the most delightful metropolitan
residences in America. Far back from the street, they are deeply
imbosomed in dense shrubbery and flowers. The tropical profusion of
the foliage retains dampness and is unwholesome, but very delicious
to the senses. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>The houses are low&mdash;this latitude is unfavorable to climbing&mdash;and
constructed of stucco, cooler than wood, and less damp than stone.
They abound in verandas, balconies, and galleries, which give to New
Orleans a peculiarly mellow and elastic look, much more alluring than
the cold, naked architecture of northern cities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An Agreeable Family Circle.</div>

<p>My new friend lived in this district, as befits a merchant prince.
His spacious grounds were rich in hawthorns, magnolias, arbor-vit&aelig;s,
orange, olive, and fig trees, and sweet with the breath of
multitudinous flowers. Though it was only the tenth of March, myriads
of pinks and trailing roses were in full bloom; Japan plums hung
ripe, while brilliant oranges of the previous year still glowed upon
the trees. His ample residence, with its choice works of art, was
quietly, unostentatiously elegant. There was no mistaking it for one
of those gilt and gaudy palaces which seem to say: "Look at the state
in which Cr&oelig;sus, my master, lives. Lo, the pictures and statues,
the Brussels and rosewood which his money has bought! Behold him
clothed in purple and fine linen, faring sumptuously every day!"</p>

<p>Three other guests were present, including a young officer of the
Louisiana troops stationed at Fort Pickens, and a lady whose husband
and brother held each a high commission in the Rebel forces of Texas.
All assumed to be Secessionists&mdash;as did nearly every person I met
in New Orleans upon first acquaintance&mdash;but displayed none of the
usual rancor and violence. In that well-poised, agreeable circle
the evening passed quickly, and at parting, the host begged me to
frequent his house. This was not distinctively southern hospitality,
for he was born and bred at the North. But in our eastern cities,
from a business man in his social position, it would

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
appear a little surprising. Had he been a Philadelphian or Bostonian,
would not his friends have deemed him a candidate for a lunatic
asylum?</p>

<p class="quotdate">
   <span class="smcap">New Orleans</span>,
   <i>March 6, 1861</i>.
</p>

<p>Taking my customary stroll last evening, I sauntered into Canal
street, and suddenly found myself in a dense and expectant crowd.
Several cheers being given upon my arrival, I naturally inferred that
it was an ovation to <cite>The Tribune</cite> correspondent; but
native modesty, and a desire to blush unseen, restrained me from any
oral public acknowledgment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <span class="smcap">Tribune Letters.&mdash;General Twiggs.</span>
</div>

<p>Just then, an obliging by-stander corrected my misapprehension by
assuring me that the demonstration was to welcome home General Daniel
E. Twiggs&mdash;the gallant hero, you know, who, stationed in Texas to
protect the Government property, recently betrayed it all into the
hands of the Rebels, to "prevent bloodshed." His friends wince at
the order striking his name from the army rolls as a coward and a
traitor, and the universal execration heaped upon his treachery even
in the border slave States.</p>

<p>They did their best to give him a flattering reception. The great
thoroughfare was decked in its holiday attire. Flags were flying,
and up and down, as far as the eye could reach, the balconies were
crowded with spectators, and the arms of long files of soldiers
glittered in the evening sunlight. One company bore a tattered and
stained banner, which went through the Mexican war. Another carried
richly ornamented colors, presented by the ladies of this city. There
were Pelican flags, and Lone Star flags, and devices unlike any thing
in the heavens above, the earth beneath, or the waters under the
earth; but nowhere could I see the old National banner.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
It was well;
on such occasion the Stars and Stripes would be sadly out of place.</p>

   <span class="smcap">Braxton Bragg.&mdash;Mr. Lincoln's Inaugural.</span>
</div>

<p>After a welcoming speech, pronouncing him "not only the soldier
of courage, but the patriot of fidelity and honor," and his own
response, declaring that <em>here</em>, at least, he would "never be
branded as a coward and traitor," the ex-general rode through some
of the principal streets in an open barouche, bareheaded, bowing
to the spectators. He is a venerable-looking man, apparently
of seventy. His large head is bald upon the top; but from the
sides a few thin snow-white locks, utterly oblivious of the
virtues of "the Twiggs Hair Dye,"<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"
href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> streamed in the breeze. He
was accompanied in the carriage by General Braxton Bragg&mdash;the
"Little-more-grape-Captain-Bragg" of Mexican war memory. By the way,
persons who ought to know declare that General Taylor never used the
expression, his actual language being: "Captain Bragg, give them
----!"</p>

<p>President Lincoln's Inaugural, looked for with intense interest,
has just arrived. All the papers denounce it bitterly. <cite>The
Delta</cite>, which has advocated Secession these ten years, makes it
a signal for the war-whoop:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"War is a great calamity; but, with all its horrors, it is
a blessing to the deep, dark, and damning infamy of such
a submission, such surrenders, as the southern people are
now called upon to make to a foreign invader. He who would
counsel such&mdash;

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
he who would seek to dampen, discourage,
or restrain the ardor and determination of the people to
resist all such pretensions, is a traitor, who should be
driven beyond our borders."</p></div>

<p>"Foreign invader," is supposed to mean the President of our common
country! The "submission" denounced so terribly would be simply the
giving up of the Government property lately stolen by the Rebels, and
the paying of the usual duties on imports!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Louisiana Convention.</div>

<p>The State convention which lately voted Louisiana out of the Union,
sits daily in Lyceum Hall. The building fronts Lafayette Square&mdash;one
of the admirable little parks which are the pride of New Orleans.
Upon the first floor is the largest public library in the city,
though it contains less than ten thousand volumes.</p>

<p>In the large hall above are the assembled delegates. Ex-Governor
Mouton, their president, a portly old gentleman, of the heavy-father
order, sits upon the platform. Below him, at a long desk, Mr. Wheat,
the florid clerk, is reading a report in a voice like a cracked
bugle. Behind the president is a life-size portrait of Washington;
at his right, a likeness of Jefferson Davis, with thin, beardless
face, and sad, hollow eyes. There is also a painting of the members,
and a copy of the Secession ordinance, with lithographed
<span lang="la">fac similes</span> of their signatures. The delegates,
you perceive, have made all the preliminary arrangements for being
immortalized. Physically, they are fine-looking men, with broad
shoulders, deep chests, well-proportioned limbs, and stature
decidedly above the northern standard. </p>

   <span class="smcap">Intro&shy;duction to Rebel Circles.</span>
</div>

<p>The good fortune which in Memphis enabled me to learn so directly
the plans and aims of the Secession leaders, did not desert me in
New Orleans. For several years I had been personally acquainted with
the editor of the leading daily journal&mdash;an accomplished writer, and
an original Secessionist. Uncertain whether he knew positively my
political views, and fearing to arouse suspicion by seeming to avoid
him, I called on him the day after reaching the city.</p>

<p>He received me kindly, never surmising my errand; invited me into
the State convention, of which he was a member; asked me to frequent
his editorial rooms; and introduced me at the "Louisiana Democratic
Club," which had now ripened into a Secession club. Among prominent
Rebels belonging to it were John Slidell and Judah P. Benjamin, of
Jewish descent, whom Senator Wade of Ohio characterized so aptly as
"an Israelite with Egyptian principles."</p>

<p>Admission to that club was a final voucher for political soundness.
The plans of the conspirators could hardly have been discussed
with more freedom in the parlor of Jefferson Davis. Another friend
introduced me at the Merchants' Reading-room, where were the same
sentiments and the same frankness. The newspaper office also was a
standing Secession caucus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intensity of the Secession Feeling.</div>

<p>These associations gave me rare facilities for studying the aims
and animus of the leading Revolutionists. I was

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
not compelled to ask questions, so constantly was information poured
into my ears. I used no further deceit than to acquiesce quietly in
the opinions everywhere heard. While I talked New Mexico and the
Rocky Mountains, my companions talked Secession; and told me more,
every day, of its secret workings, than as a mere stranger I could
have learned in a month. Socially, they were genial and agreeable.
Their hatred of New England, which they seemed to consider "the cruel
cause of all our woes," was very intense. They were also wont to
denounce <cite>The Tribune</cite>, and sometimes its unknown Southern
correspondents, with peculiar bitterness. At first their maledictions
fell with startling and unpleasant force upon my ears, though I
always concurred. But in time I learned to hear them not only with
serenity, but with a certain quiet enjoyment of the ludicrousness of
the situation.</p>

<p>I had not a single acquaintance in the city, whom I knew to be a
Union man, or to whom I could talk without reserve. This was very
irksome&mdash;at times almost unbearable. How I longed to open my
heart to somebody! Recently as I had left the North, and strongly as
I was anchored in my own convictions, the pressure on every hand was
so great, all intelligence came so distorted through Rebel mediums,
that at times I was nearly swept from my moorings. I could fully
understand how many strong Union men had at last been drawn into the
almost irresistible tide. It was an inexpressible relief to read the
northern newspapers at the Democratic Club. There, even <cite>The
Tribune</cite> was on file. The club was so far above suspicion that
it might have patronized with impunity the organ of William Lloyd
Garrison or Frederick Douglass.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <span class="smcap">Rebel Newspapers and President Lincoln.</span>
</div>

<p>The vituperation which the southern journals heaped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
upon Abraham Lincoln was something marvelous. The speeches of the
newly elected President on his way to Washington, were somewhat
rugged and uncouth; not equal to the reputation he won in the
great senatorial canvass with Douglas, where debate and opposition
developed his peculiar powers and stimulated his unrivaled logic.
The Rebel papers drew daily contrasts between the two Presidents,
pronouncing Mr. Davis a gentleman, scholar, statesman; and Mr.
Lincoln a vulgarian, buffoon, demagogue. One of their favorite
epithets was "idiot;" another, "baboon;" just as the Roman satirists,
fifteen hundred years ago, were wont to ridicule the great Julian as
an ape and a hairy savage.</p>

<p>The times have changed. While I write some of the same journals, not
yet extinguished by the fortunes of war, denounce Jefferson Davis
with equal coarseness and bitterness, as an elegant, vacillating
sentimentalist; and mourn that he does not possess the rugged common
sense and indomitable perseverance displayed by Abraham Lincoln!</p>

<p>While keeping up appearances on the Mexican question, by frequent
inquiries about the semi-monthly steamers for Vera Cruz, I devoted
myself ostensibly to the curious features of the city. Odd enough
it sounded to hear persons say, "Let us go <em>up</em> to the river;" but
the phrase is accurate. New Orleans is two feet lower than the
Mississippi, and protected against overflow by a dike or levee. The
city is quite narrow, and is drained into a great swamp in the rear.
In front, new deposits of soil are constantly and rapidly made. Four
of the leading business streets, nearest the levee, traverse what,
a few years ago, was the bed of the river. Anywhere, by digging two
feet below the surface, one comes to water. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>The earth is peculiarly spongy and yielding. The unfinished Custom
House, built of granite from Quincy, Massachusetts, has sunk about
two feet since its commencement, in 1846. The same is true of other
heavy buildings. Cellars and wells being impossible in the watery
soil, refrigerators serve for the one, and cylindrical upright wooden
cisterns, standing aboveground, like towers, for the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cemeteries Above the Ground.</div>

<p>In the cemeteries the tombs are called "ovens." They are all built
aboveground, of brick, stone, or stucco, closed up with mortar and
cement. Sometimes the walls crack open, revealing the secrets of the
charnel-house. Decaying coffins are visible within; and once I saw a
human skull protruding from the fissure of a tomb. Here, indeed,</p>

<div class="poem">
   <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i0">"Imperial C&aelig;sar, dead, and turned to clay,<br /></span>
      <span class="i0">Might stop a hole to keep the wind away."<br /></span>
   </div>
</div>

<p>Despite this revolting feature, the Catholic cemeteries are
especially interesting<ins>.</ins> About the humblest of the monuments,
artificial wreaths, well-tended rose-beds, garlands of fresh flowers,
changed daily, and vases inserted in the walls, to catch water and
attract the birds, evince a tender, unforgetful attention to the
resting-place of departed friends. More than half the inscriptions
are French or Spanish. Very few make any allusion to a future life.
One imposing column marks the grave of Dominique You, the pirate,
whose single virtue of patriotism, exhibited under Jackson during the
war of 1815, hardly justifies, upon his monument, the magnificent
eulogy of Bayard: "The hero of a hundred battles,&mdash;a chevalier
without fear and without reproach."</p>

<p>In New Orleans, grass growing upon the streets is no sign of
decadence. Stimulated by the rich, moist soil, it

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
springs up in profusion, not only in the smaller thoroughfares,
but among the bricks and paving-stones of the leading business
avenues.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The French Quarter of New Orleans.</div>

<p>Canal street is perhaps the finest promenade on the continent. It
is twice the width of Broadway, and in the middle has two lines of
trees, with a narrow lawn between them, extending its entire length.
At night, as the long parallel rows of gas-lights glimmer through
the quivering foliage, growing narrower and narrower in perspective
till they unite and blend into one, it is a striking spectacle&mdash;a
gorgeous feast of the lanterns. On the lower side of it is the
"French Quarter," more un-American even than the famous German
portion of Cincinnati known as "Over the Rhine." Here you may stroll
for hours, "a straggler from another civilization," hearing no word
in your native tongue, seeing no object to remove the impression of
an ancient French city. The dingy houses, "familiar with forgotten
years," call up memories of old Mexican towns. They are grim,
dusky relics of antiquity, usually but one story high, with steep
projecting roofs, tiled or slated, wooden shutters over the doors,
and multitudinous eruptions of queer old gables and dormer windows.</p>

<p>New Orleans is the most Parisian of American cities. Opera-houses,
theaters, and all other places of amusement are open on Sunday
nights. The great French market wears its crowning glory only on
Sunday mornings. Then the venders occupy not only several spacious
buildings, but adjacent streets and squares. Their wares seem
boundless in variety. Any thing you please&mdash;edible, drinkable,
wearable, ornamental, or serviceable&mdash;from Wenham ice to vernal
flowers and tropical fruits&mdash;from Indian moccasins to a silk
dress-pattern&mdash;from

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
ancient Chinese books to the freshest morning papers&mdash;ask, and
it shall be given unto you.</p>

<div class="sidenote">French Market on Sunday Morning.</div>

<p>Sit down in a stall, over your tiny cup of excellent coffee, and
you are hobnobbing with the antipodes&mdash;your next neighbor may be
from Greenland's icy mountains, or India's coral strand. Get up to
resume your promenade, and you hear a dozen languages in as many
steps; while every nation, and tribe, and people&mdash;French, English,
Irish, German, Spanish, Creole, Chinese, African, Quadroon, Mulatto,
American&mdash;jostles you in good-humored confusion.</p>

<p>Some gigantic negresses, with gaudy kerchiefs, like turbans, about
their heads, are selling fruits, and sit erect as palm-trees.
They look like African or Indian princesses, a little annoyed at
being separated from their thrones and retinues, but none the less
regal "for a' that." At every turn little girls, with rich Creole
complexions and brilliant eyes, offer you aromatic bouquets of pinks,
roses, verbenas, orange and olive blossoms, and other flowers to
you unknown, unless, being a woman, you are a botanist by "gift of
fortune," or, a man, that science has "come by nature."</p>

<p>Upon Jackson Square, a delicious bit of verdure fronting
the river, gloom antique public buildings, which were the
seat of government in the days of the old Spanish <span
lang="la">r&eacute;gime</span>. Near them stands the equally
ancient cathedral, richly decorated within, where devout Catholics
still worship. Its great congregations are mosaics of all hues and
nationalities, mingling for the moment in the democratic equality of
the Roman Church.</p>

<p>Attending service in the cathedral one Sunday morning, I found the
aisles crowded with volunteers who, on the eve of departure for
the debatable ground of Fort Pickens, had assembled to witness the
consecration of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
their Secession flag, a ceremonial conducted with great pomp and
solemnity by the French priests.</p>

<p>In the First Presbyterian Church, the Rev. Dr. Palmer, a divine of
talent and local reputation, might be heard advocating the extremest
Rebel views. The southerners had formerly been very bitter in their
denunciation of political preaching; but now the pulpit, as usual,
made obeisance to the pews, and the pews beamed encouragement on the
pulpit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pressing Cotton by Machinery.</div>

<p>If I may go abruptly from church to cotton&mdash;and they were not far
apart in New Orleans&mdash;a visit to one of the great cotton-presses
was worthy of note. It is a low building, occupying an entire
square, with a hollow court in the center. It was filled with
heaped-up cotton-bales, which overran their limits and covered the
adjacent sidewalks. Negroes stood all day at the doors receiving and
discharging cotton. The bales are compressed by heavy machinery,
driven by steam, that they may occupy the least space in shipping.
They are first condensed on the plantations by screw-presses; the
cotton is compact upon arrival here; but this great iron machine,
which embraces the bales in a hug of two hundred tons, diminishes
them one-third more. The laborers are negroes and Frenchmen, who
chant a strange, mournful refrain in time with their movements.</p>

<p>The ropes of a bale are cut; it is thrown under the press; the
great iron jaws of the monster close convulsively, rolling it under
the tongue as a sweet morsel. The ropes are tightened and again
tied, the cover stitched up, and the bale rolled out to make room
for another&mdash;all in about fifty seconds. It weighs five hundred
pounds, but the workmen <del>sieze</del><ins>seize</ins> it on all
sides with their iron hooks, and toss it about like a schoolboy's
ball. The superintendent informed me that they pressed,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
during the previous winter, more than forty thousand bales.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <span class="smcap">The Barracks. &mdash;The New Orleans Levee.</span>
</div>

<p>The Rebels, with their early <em>penchant</em> for capturing empty
forts and full treasuries, had seized the United States Branch Mint,
containing three hundred thousand dollars, and the National barracks,
garrisoned at the time by a single sergeant. Visiting, with a party
of <del>gentleman</del><ins>gentlemen</ins>, the historic Jackson
battle-ground, four miles below the city, I obtained a glimpse of
the tall, gloomy Mint, and spent an hour in the long, low, white,
deep-balconied barracks beside the river.</p>

<p>The Lone Star flag of Louisiana was flying from the staff. A hundred
and twenty freshly enlisted men of the State troops composed the
garrison. Three of the officers, recent seceders from the Federal
army, invited us into their quarters, to discuss political affairs
over their Bourbon and cigars. As all present assumed to be sanguine
and uncompromising Rebels, the conversation was one-sided and
uninteresting.</p>

<p>We drove down the river-bank along the almost endless rows of ships
and steamboats. The commerce of New Orleans, was more imposing than
that of any other American city except New York. It seemed to warrant
the picture painted by the unrivaled orator, Prentiss, of the future
years, "when this Crescent City shall have filled her golden horn."
The long landing was now covered with western produce, cotton,
and sugar, and fenced with the masts of hundreds of vessels. Some
displayed the three-striped and seven-starred flag of the "Southern
Confederacy," many the ensigns of foreign nations, and a few the
Stars and Stripes.</p>

<p>We were soon among the old houses of the Creoles.<a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
These anomalous people&mdash;a very large element of the
population&mdash;properly belong to a past age or another land, and
find themselves sadly at variance with America in the nineteenth
century. They seldom improve or sell their property; permit the old
fences and palings to remain around their antique houses; are content
to live upon small incomes, and rarely enter the modern districts.
It is even asserted that old men among them have spent their whole
lives in New Orleans without ever going above Canal street! Many have
visited Paris, but are profoundly ignorant of Washington, New York,
Philadelphia, and other northern cities. They are devout Catholics,
sudden and quick in quarrel, and duelling continues one of their
favorite recreations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Visit to the Jackson Battle-Ground.</div>

<p>We stopped at the old Spanish house&mdash;deeply embowered in
trees&mdash;occupied as head-quarters by General Jackson, and saw the
upper window from which, glass in hand, he witnessed the approach
of the enemy. The dwelling is inhabited, and bears marks of the
cannon-balls fired to dislodge him. Like his city quarters&mdash;a plain
brick edifice, at one hundred and six, Royal-street, New Orleans&mdash;it
is unchanged in appearance since that historic Eighth of January.</p>

<p>A few hundred yards from the river, we reached the battle-ground
where, in 1815, four thousand motley, undisciplined, half-armed
recruits defeated twelve thousand veterans&mdash;the Americans losing
but five men, the British seven hundred. This enormous disparity is
explained by the sheltered position of one party behind a breastwork,
and the terrible exposure of the other in its march, by solid
columns, of half a mile over an open field, without protection of
hillock or tree. A horrible field, whence the Great Reaper gathered a
bloody harvest! </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Incidents of the Battle.</div>

<p>The swamp here is a mile from the river. Jackson dug a canal between
them, throwing up the earth on one side for a breastwork, and turning
a stream of water from the Mississippi through the trench. The
British had an extravagant fear of the swamp, and believed that,
attempting to penetrate it, they would be ingulfed in treacherous
depths. So they marched up, with unflinching Saxon courage, in the
teeth of that terrible fire from the Americans, ranged four deep,
behind the fortification; and the affair became a massacre rather
than a battle.</p>

<p>The spongy soil of the breastwork (the tradition that bales of
cotton were used is a fiction) absorbed the balls without any
damage. It first proved what has since been abundantly demonstrated
in the Crimean war, and the American Rebellion&mdash;the superiority of
earthworks over brick and stone. The most solid masonry will be
broken and battered down sooner or later, but shells and solid shot
can do little harm to earthworks.</p>

<p>Jackson's army was a reproduction of Falstaff's ragamuffins. It was
made up of Kentucky backwoodsmen, New Orleans clergymen, lawyers,
merchants and clerks; pirates and ruffians just released from the
calaboose to aid in the defense; many negroes, free and slave, with
a liberal infusion of nondescript city vagabonds, noticeable chiefly
for their tatters, and seeming, from their "looped and windowed
raggedness," to hang out perpetual flags of truce to the enemy.</p>

<p>Judah Trouro, a leading merchant, while carrying ammunition, was
struck in the rear by a cannon-ball, which cut and bore away a large
slice of his body; but, in spite of the awkward loss, he lived many
years, to leave an enviable memory for philanthropy and public

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
spirit. Parton tells of a young American who, during the battle,
stooped forward to light a cigar; and when he recovered his position
saw that a man exactly behind him was blown to pieces, and his brains
scattered over the parapet, by an exploding shell.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Peculiar Free Negro Population.</div>

<p>More than half of Jackson's command was composed of negroes, who were
principally employed with the spade, but several battalions of them
were armed, and in the presence of the whole army received the thanks
of General Jackson for their gallantry. On each anniversary the negro
survivors of the battle always turned out in large numbers&mdash;so large,
indeed, as to excite the suspicion that they were not genuine.</p>

<p>The free colored population, at the time of my visit, was a very
peculiar feature of New Orleans. Its members were chiefly of San
Domingo origin; held themselves altogether aloof from the other
blacks, owned numerous slaves, and were the most rigorous of masters.
Frequently their daughters were educated in Paris, married whites,
and in some cases the traces of their negro origin were almost
entirely obliterated. This, however, is not peculiar to that class.
It is very unusual anywhere in the South to find persons of pure
African lineage. A tinge of white blood is almost always detected.</p>

<p>Our company had an invaluable cicerone in the person of Judge
Alexander Walker, author of "Jackson and New Orleans," the most clear
and entertaining work upon the battle, its causes and results, yet
contributed to American history. He had toiled unweariedly through
all the official records, and often visited the ground with men who
participated in the engagement. He pointed out positions, indicated
the spot where Packenham fell, and drew largely upon his rich fund of
anecdote, tradition, and biography. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>A plain, unfinished shaft of Missouri limestone, upon a rough
brick foundation, now marks the battle-field. It was commenced by
a legislative appropriation; but the fund became exhausted and the
work ceased. The level cotton plantation, ditched for draining, now
shows no evidence of the conflict, except the still traceable line of
the old canal, with detached pools of stagnant water in a fringe of
reeds, willows, and live oaks.</p>

<p>A negro patriarch, with silvery hair, and legs infirm of purpose,
hobbled up, to exhibit some balls collected on the ground. The
bullets, which were flattened, he assured us, had "hit somebody."
No doubt they were spurious; but we purchased a few buckshots and
fragments of shell from the ancient Ethiop, and rode back to the
city along avenues lined with flowers and shrubbery. Here grew the
palm&mdash;the characteristic tree of the South. It is neither graceful
nor beautiful; but looks like an inverted umbrella upon a long,
slender staff. Ordinary pictures very faithfully represent it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">All About a "Black Republican Flag."</div>

<p class="quotdate">
   <span class="smcap">New Orleans</span>, <i>March 11, 1861</i>.
</p>

<p>We are a good deal exercised, just now, about a new grievance. The
papers charged, a day or two since, that the ship Adelaide Bell, from
New Hampshire, had flung defiant to the breeze a Black Republican
flag, and that her captain vowed he would shoot anybody attempting
to cut it down. As one of the journals remarked, "his audacity was
outrageous." <span lang="fr">En passant</span>, do you know what a
Black Republican flag is? I have never encountered that mythical
entity in my travels; but 'tis a fearful thing to think of&mdash;is
it not?</p>

<p>The reporter of <cite>The Crescent</cite>, with charming ingenuousness,
describes it as "so much like the flag of the late United States,
that few would notice the difference."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
In fact, he adds, it <em>is</em> the old Stars and Stripes, with a red
stripe instead of a white one immediately below the union. Of
course, we are greatly incensed. It is flat burglary, you know, to
love the Star Spangled Banner itself; and as for a Black Republican
flag&mdash;why, that is most tolerable and not to be endured.</p>

<p>Captain Robertson, the "audacious," has been compelled, publicly, to
deny the imputation. He asserts that, in the simplicity of his heart,
he has been using it for years as a United States flag. But the
newspapers adhere stoutly to the charge; so the presumption is that
the captain is playing some infernal Yankee trick. Who shall deliver
us from the body of this Black Republican flag?</p>

<p>If it were possible, I would like to see the "Southern Confederacy"
work out its own destiny; to see how Slavery would flourish, isolated
from free States; how the securities of a government, founded on
the right of any of its members to break it up at pleasure, would
stand in the markets of the world; how the principle of Democracy
would sustain itself in a confederation whose corner-stones are
aristocracy, oligarchy, despotism. This is the government which,
in the language of one of its admirers, shall be "stronger than
the bonds of Orion, and benigner than the sweet influences of the
Pleiades."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vice-Pres&shy;ident Hamlin a Mulatto.</div>

<p>A few days since, I was in a circle of southern ladies, when one of
them remarked:</p>

<p>"I am glad Lincoln has not been killed."</p>

<p>"Why so?" asked another.</p>

<p>"Because, if he had been, Hamlin would become President, and it would
be a shame to have a mulatto at the head of the Government."</p>

<p>A little discussion which followed developed that every lady
present, except one, believed Mr. Hamlin a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
mulatto. Yet the company was comparatively intelligent, and all
its members live in a flourishing commercial metropolis. You may
infer something of the knowledge of the North in rural districts,
enlightened only by weekly visits from Secession newspapers!</p>

<p>We are enjoying that soft air "which comes caressingly to the
brow, and produces in the lungs a luxurious delight." I notice,
on the streets, more than one premonition of summer, in the form
of linen coats. The yards and cemeteries, smiling with myriads of
roses and pinks, are carpeted with velvet grass; the morning air is
redolent of orange and clover blossoms, and nosegays abound, sweet
with the breath of the tropics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Northerners Living in the South.</div>

<p class="quotdate"><i>March 15.</i></p>

<p>Men of northern nativity are numerous throughout the Gulf States.
Many are leading merchants of the cities, and a few, planters in the
interior. Some have gone north to stay until the storm is over. A
part of those who remain out-Herod the native fire-eaters in zeal for
Secession. Their violence is suspicious; it oversteps the modesty
of nature. I was recently in a mixed company, where one person was
conspicuously bitter upon the border slave States, denouncing them
as "playing second fiddle to the Abolitionists," and "traitors to
southern rights."</p>

<p>"Who is he?" I asked of a southern gentleman beside me.</p>

<p>"He?" was the indignant reply; "why, he is a northerner, ---- him!
He is talking all this for effect. What does he care about our
rights? He don't own slaves, and wasn't raised in the South; if it
were fashionable, he would be an Abolitionist. I'd as soon trust a
nigger-stealer as such a man!" </p>

   </div>
</div>

<p>The city was measurably quiet, but arrests, and examinations of
suspected Abolitionists, were frequent. In general, I felt little
personal disquietude, except the fear of encountering some one who
knew my antecedents; but about once a week something transpired to
make me thoroughly uncomfortable for the moment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <span class="smcap">Preparing and Transmitting Cor&shy;res&shy;pon&shy;dence.</span>
</div>

<p>I attended daily the Louisiana Convention, sitting among the
spectators. I could take no notes, but relied altogether upon memory.
In corresponding, I endeavored to cover my tracks as far as possible.
Before leaving Cincinnati, I had encountered a friend just from New
Orleans, and induced him to write for me one or two letters, dated
in the latter city. They were copied, with some changes of style,
and published. Hence investigation would have shown that <cite>The
Tribune</cite> writer began two or three weeks before I reached the
city, and thrown a serious obstacle in the way of identifying him.</p>

<p>My dispatches, transmitted sometimes by mail, sometimes by express,
were addressed alternately to half a dozen banking and commercial
firms in New York, who at once forwarded them to <cite>The Tribune</cite>
editorial rooms. They were written like ordinary business letters,
treating of trade and monetary affairs, and containing drafts upon
supposititious persons, quite princely in amount. I never learned,
however, that they appreciably enlarged the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
exchequer of their recipients. Indeed, they were a good deal like the
voluminous epistles which Mr. Toots, in his school-boy days, was in
the habit of writing to himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Guarding Letters against Scrutiny.</div>

<p>I used a system of cipher, by which all phrases between certain
private marks were to be exactly reversed in printing. Thus, if I
characterized any one as "patriot and an honest man," inclosing
the sentence in brackets, it was to be rendered a "demagogue and a
scoundrel." All matter between certain other marks was to be omitted.
If a paragraph commenced at the very edge of a sheet, it was to be
printed precisely as it stood. But beginning it half across the page
indicated that it contained something to be translated by the cipher.</p>

<p>The letters, therefore, even if examined, would hardly be
comprehended. Whether tampered with or not, they always reached the
office. I never kept any papers on my person, or in my room, which
could excite suspicion, if read.</p>

<p>In writing, I assumed the tone of an old citizen, sometimes remarking
that during a residence of fourteen years in New Orleans, I had
never before seen such a whirlwind of passion, etc. In recording
incidents I was often compelled to change names, places, and dates,
though always faithful to the fact. Toward the close of my stay, the
correspondence appearing to pass unopened, I gave minute and exact
details, designing to be in the North before the letters could return
in print.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <span class="smcap">A Phil&shy;adel&shy;phian among the Rebels.</span>
</div>

<p>Two incidents will illustrate the condition of affairs better than
any general description. Soon after Mr. Lincoln's election, a
Philadelphian reached New Orleans, on a collecting tour. One evening
he was standing in the counting-room of a merchant, who asked him:&mdash; </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, now you Black Republicans have elected your President, what
are you going to do next?"</p>

<p>"We will show you," was the laughing response.</p>

<p>Both spoke in jest; but the bookkeeper of the house, standing by,
with his back turned, belonged to the Minute Men, who, that very
evening, by a delegation of fifty, waited on the Philadelphian at
the St. James Hotel. They began by demanding whether he was a Black
Republican. He at once surmised that he was obtaining a glimpse of
the hydra of Secession, beside which the armed rhinoceros were an
agreeable companion, and the rugged Russian bear a pleasant household
pet. His face grew pallid, but he replied, with dignity and firmness:</p>

<p>"I deny your right to ask me any such questions."</p>

<p>The inquisitors, who were of good social position and gentlemanly
manners, claimed that the public emergency was so great as to justify
them in examining all strangers who excited suspicion; and that he
left them only the alternative of concluding him an Abolitionist and
an incendiary. At last he informed them truthfully that he had never
sympathized with the Anti-Slavery party, and had always voted the
Democratic ticket. They next inquired if the house which employed him
was Black Republican.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he replied, "it is a <em>business</em> firm, not a political
one. I never heard politics mentioned by either of the partners. I
don't know whether they are Republicans or Democrats."</p>

<p>He cheerfully permitted his baggage to be searched by the Minute Men,
who, finding nothing objectionable, bade him good-evening. But, just
after they left, a mob of Roughs, attracted by the report that an
Abolitionist was stopping there, entered the hotel. They

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
were very noisy and profane, crying&mdash;"Let us see him; bring out
the scoundrel!"</p>

<p>His friend, the merchant, spirited him out of the house through a
back door, and drove him to the railway station, whence a midnight
train was starting for the North. His pursuers, finding the room of
their victim empty, followed in hot haste to the d&eacute;p&ocirc;t. The merchant
saw them coming, and again conveyed him away to a private room. He
was kept concealed for three days, until the excitement subsided, and
then went north by a night train.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Secession vs. Sincerity.</div>

<p>One of the clerks at the hotel where I was boarding had been an
acquaintance of mine in the North ten years before. Though I now saw
him several times a day, politics were seldom broached between us.
But, whenever they came up, we both talked mild Secession. I did
not believe him altogether sincere, and I presume he did me equal
justice; but instinct is a great matter, and we were cowards on
instinct.</p>

<p>During the next summer, I chanced to meet him unexpectedly in
Chicago. After we exchanged greetings, his first question was&mdash;</p>

<p>"What did you honestly think of Secession while in New Orleans?"</p>

<p>"Do you know what I was doing there?"</p>

<p>"On your way to Mexico, were you not?"</p>

<p>"No; corresponding for <cite>The Tribune</cite>."</p>

<p>His eyes expanded visibly at this information, and he inquired, with
some earnestness&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you know what would have been done with you if you had been
detected?"</p>

<p>"I have my suspicions, but, of course, do not know. Do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; you would have been hung!" </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you think so?"</p>

<p>"I am sure of it. You would not have had a shadow of chance for your
life!"</p>

<p>My friend knew the Secessionists thoroughly, and his evidence was
doubtless trustworthy. I felt no inclination to test it by repeating
the experiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <span class="smcap">A Mania for Southern Manu&shy;fac&shy;turing.</span>
</div>

<p>The establishment of domestic manufactures was always a favorite
theme throughout the South; but the manufactures themselves continued
very rudimentary. The furniture dealers, for example, made a pretense
of making their own wares. They invariably showed customers through
their workshops, and laid great stress upon their encouragement of
southern industry; but they really received seven-eighths of their
furniture from the North, having it delivered at back-doors, under
cover of the night.</p>

<p>Secession gave a new impetus to all sorts of manufacturing projects.
The daily newspapers constantly advocated them, but were quite
oblivious of the vital truth that skilled labor will have opinions,
and opinions can not be tolerated in a slave community.</p>

<p>One sign on Canal-street read, "Sewing Machines manufactured on
Southern Soil"&mdash;a statement whose truth was more than doubtful. The
agent of a rival machine advertised that his patent was <em>owned</em> in
New Orleans, and, therefore, pre-eminently worthy of patronage.
Little pasteboard boxes were labeled "Superior Southern Matches," and
the newspapers announced exultingly that a candy factory was about to
be established.</p>

<p>But the greatest stress was laid upon the Southern Shoe Factory, on
St. Ferdinand-street&mdash;a joint stock concern, with a capital of one
hundred thousand dollars. It was only two months old, and, therefore,
experimental;

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
but its work was in great demand, and it was the favorite
illustration of the feasibility of southern manufactures.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Visit to the Southern Shoe Factory.</div>

<p>Sauntering in, one evening, I introduced myself as a stranger, drawn
thither by curiosity. The superintendent courteously invited me to go
through the establishment with him.</p>

<p>His physiognomy and manners impressed me as unmistakably northern;
but, to make assurance doubly sure, I ventured some remark which
inferred that he was a native of New Orleans. He at once informed me
that he was from St. Louis. When I pursued the matter further, by
speaking of some recent improvements in that city, he replied:</p>

<p>"I was born in St. Louis, but left there when I was twelve months
old. Philadelphia has been my home since, until I came here to take
charge of this establishment."</p>

<p>The work was nearly all done with machinery run by steam. As we
walked through the basement, and he pointed out the implements for
cutting and pressing sole-leather, I could not fail to notice that
every one bore the label of its manufacturer, followed by these
incendiary words: "Boston, Massachusetts!"</p>

<p>Then we ascended to the second story, where sewing and pegging
were going on. All the stitching was done as in the large northern
manufactories, with sewing-machines run by steam&mdash;a combination of
two of the greatest mechanical inventions. Add a third, and in the
printing-press, the steam-engine, and the sewing-machine, you have
the most potent material agencies of civilization.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Where its Facilities Came From.</div>

<p>Here was the greatest curiosity of all&mdash;the patent pegging-machine,
which cuts out the pegs from a thin

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
strip of wood, inserts the awl, and pegs two rows around the sole
of a large shoe, more regularly and durably than it can be done by
hand&mdash;all in less than twenty-five seconds. Need I add that it
is a Yankee invention? One machine for finishing, smoothing, and
polishing the soles came from Paris; but all the others bore that
ominous label, "Boston, Massachusetts!" In the third story, devoted
to fitting the soles and other finishing processes, the same fact was
apparent&mdash;every machine was from New England.</p>

<p>The work was confined exclusively to coarse plantation brogans,
which were sold at from thirteen to nineteen dollars per case of
twelve pairs. Shoes of the same quality, at the great factories in
Milford, Haverhill, and Lynn, Massachusetts, were then selling by
the manufacturers at prices ranging from six to thirteen dollars per
case. In one apartment we found three men making boxes for packing
the shoes, from boards already sawed and dressed.</p>

<p>"Where do you get your lumber?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It comes from Illinois," replied my cicerone. "We have it planed and
cut out in St. Louis&mdash;labor is so high here."</p>

<p>"Your workmen, I presume, are from this city?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. The leading men in all departments are from the North,
mainly from Massachusetts and Philadelphia. We are compelled to pay
them high salaries&mdash;from sixty to three hundred dollars per month.
The subordinate workmen, whom we hope soon to put in their places, we
found here. We employ forty-seven persons, and turn out two hundred
and fifty pairs of brogans daily. We find it impossible to supply the
demand, and are introducing more machinery, which will soon enable us
to make six hundred pairs per day." </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">How "Southern" Shoes were Made.</div>

<p>"Where do you procure the birch for pegs?"</p>

<p>"From Massachusetts. It comes to us cut in strips and rolled, ready
for use."</p>

<p>"Where do you get your leather?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir" (with a searching look, as if a little suspicious of
being quizzed), "<em>it</em> also comes from the North, at present; but we
shall soon have tanneries established. The South, especially Texas,
produces the finest hides in the country; but they are nearly all
sent north, to be tanned and curried, and then brought back in the
form of leather."</p>

<p>Thanking the superintendent for his courtesy, and wishing him
a very good evening, I strolled homeward, reflecting upon the
<em>Southern</em> Shoe Factory. It was admirably calculated to appeal
to local patriotism, and demonstrate the feasibility of southern
manufacturing. Its northern machinery, run by northern workmen, under
a northern superintendent, turned out brogans of northern leather,
fastened with northern pegs, and packed in cases of northern pine, at
an advance of only about one hundred per cent. upon northern prices!</p>

<p>New Orleans afforded to the stranger few illustrations of the
"Peculiar Institution." Along the streets, you saw the sign, "Slave
D&eacute;p&ocirc;t&mdash;Negroes bought and sold," upon buildings which were filled
with blacks of every age and of both sexes, waiting for purchasers.
The newspapers, although recognizing slavery in general as the
distinguishing cause which made southern gentlemen gallant and
"high-toned," and southern ladies fair and accomplished, were yet
reticent of details. They would sometimes record briefly the killing
of a master by his negroes; the arrest of A., charged with being
an Abolitionist; of B., for harboring or tampering with slaves; of
C.&mdash;f. m. c. (free man of color)&mdash;for violating one of the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
many laws that hedged him in; and, very rarely, of D., for cruelty
to his slaves. But their advertising columns were filled with
announcements of slave auctions, and long descriptions of the negroes
to be sold. Said <cite>The Crescent</cite>:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Studying Southern Society.</div>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"We have for a long time thought that no man ought to
   be allowed to write for the northern Press, unless he has
   passed at least two years of his existence in the Slave
   States of the South, doing nothing but studying southern
   institutions, southern society, and the character and
   sentiments of the southern people."</p>
</div>

<p>There was much truth in this, though not in the sense intended
by the writer. Strangers spending but a short time in the South
<em>were</em> liable to very erroneous views. They saw only the exterior
of a system, which looked pleasant and patriarchal. They had no
opportunity of learning that, within, it was full of dead men's bones
and all uncleanness. Northern men were so often deceived as to make
one skeptical of the traditional acuteness of the Yankee. The genial
and hospitable southerners would draw the long bow fearfully. A
Memphis gentleman assured a northern friend of mine that, on Sundays,
it was impossible for a white man to hire a carriage in that city, as
the negroes monopolized them all for pleasure excursions!</p>

<p>One of my New Orleans companions, who was frank and candid upon other
subjects, used to tell me the most egregious stories respecting
the slaves. As, for instance, that their marriage-vows were almost
universally held sacred by the masters; the virtue of negro women
respected, and families rarely separated. I preserved my gravity,
never disputing him; but he must have known that a visit to any of
the half-dozen slave auctions, within three minutes' walk of his
office, would disprove all these statements. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Reporting a Slave Auction.</div>

<p>These slave auctions were the only public places where the primary
social formation of the South cropped out sharply. I attended them
frequently, as the best school for "studying southern institutions,
southern society, and the character and sentiments of the southern
people."</p>

<p>I remember one in which eighty slaves were sold, one after
another. A second, at which twenty-one negroes were disposed of, I
reported, <span lang="la">in extenso</span>, from notes written upon
blank cards in my pocket during its progress. Of course, it was not
safe to make any memoranda openly.</p>

<p>The auction was in the great bar-room of the St. Charles Hotel, a
spacious, airy octagonal apartment, with a circular range of Ionic
columns. The marble bar, covering three sides of the room, was doing
a brisk business. Three perturbed tapsters were bustling about to
supply with fluids the bibulous crowd, which by no means did its
spiriting gently.</p>

<p>The negroes stood in a row, in front of the auctioneer's platform,
with numbered tickets pinned upon their coats and frocks. Thus, a
young woman with a baby in her arms, who rolled his great white eyes
in astonishment, was ticketed "No. 7." Referring to the printed list,
I found this description:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"7. Betty, aged 15 years, and child 4 months, No.
   1 field-hand and house-servant, very likely. Fully
   guaranteed."</p>
</div>

<p>In due time, Betty and her boy were bid off for $1,165.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sale of a White Girl.</div>

<p>Those already sold were in a group at the other end of the platform.
One young woman, in a faded frock and sun-bonnet, and wearing gold
ear-rings, had straight brown hair, hazel eyes, pure European
features, and a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
very light complexion. I was unable to detect in her face the
slightest trace of negro lineage. Her color, features, and movements
were those of an ordinary country girl of the white working class
in the South. A by-stander assured me that she was sold under the
hammer, just before I entered. She associated familiarly with the
negroes, and left the room with them when the sale was concluded; but
no one would suspect, under other circumstances, that she was tinged
with African blood.</p>

<p>The spectators, about two hundred in number, were not more than
one-tenth bidders. There were planters from the interior, with broad
shoulders and not unpleasing faces; city merchants, and cotton
factors; fast young men in pursuit of excitement, and strangers
attracted by curiosity.</p>

<p>Among the latter was a spruce young man in the glossiest of
broadcloth, and the whitest of linen, with an unmistakable Boston
air. He lounged carelessly about, and endeavored to look quite
at ease, but made a very brilliant failure. His restless eye and
tell-tale countenance indicated clearly that he was among the
Philistines for the first time, and held them in great terror.</p>

<p>There were some professional slave-dealers, and many nondescripts who
would represent the various shades between loafers and blacklegs, in
any free community. They were men of thick lips, sensual mouths, full
chins, large necks, and bleared eyes, suggesting recent dissipation.
They were a "hard-looking" company. I would not envy a known
Abolitionist who should fall into their unrestrained clutches. No
prudent life-insurance company would take a risk in him.</p>

<p>The auctioneer descanted eloquently upon the merits of each of his
chattels, seldom dwelling upon one more

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
than five minutes. An herculean fellow, with an immense chest, was
dressed in rusty black, and wore a superannuated silk hat. He looked
the decayed gentleman to a charm, and was bid off for $840. A plump
yellow boy, also in black, silk hat and all, seemed to think being
sold rather a good joke, grinning broadly the while, and, at some
jocular remark, showing two rows of white teeth almost from ear to
ear. He brought $1,195, and appeared proud of commanding so high a
figure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Women on the Block.</div>

<p>Several light quadroon girls brought large prices. One was surrounded
by a group of coarse-looking men, who addressed her in gross
language, shouting with laughter as she turned away to hide her face,
and rudely manipulating her arms, shoulders, and breasts. Her age was
not given. "That's the trouble with niggers," remarked a planter to
me; "you never can tell how old they are, and so you get swindled."
One mother and her infant sold for $1,415.</p>

<p>Strolling into the St. Charles, a few days later, I found two
sales in full career. On one platform the auctioneer was recommending
a well-proportioned, full-blooded negro, as "a very likely and
intelligent young man, gentlemen, who would have sold readily, a year
ago, for thirteen hundred dollars. And now I am offered only eight
hundred&mdash;eight hundred&mdash;eight hundred&mdash;eight hundred;
<em>are</em> you all done?"</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the room another auctioneer, in stentorian
tones, proclaimed the merits of a pretty quadroon girl, tastefully
dressed, and wearing gold finger and ear rings. "The girl, gentlemen,
is only fifteen years old; warranted sound in every particular, an
excellent seamstress, which would make her worth a thousand dollars,
if she had <em>no other qualifications</em>. She is sold for no fault, but
simply because her owner must have

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
money. No married man had better buy her; she is too handsome."
The girl was bid off at $1,100, and stepped down to make way for a
field-hand. Ascending the steps, he stumbled and fell, at which the
auctioneer saluted him with "Come along, G-d d--n you!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <span class="smcap">Mothers and Children.&mdash;"Defects."</span>
</div>

<p>Mothers and their very young children were not often separated; but
I frequently saw husbands and wives sold apart; no pretense being
made of keeping them together. Negroes were often offered with what
was decorously described as a "defect" in the arm, or shoulder.
Sometimes it appeared to be the result of accident, sometimes of
punishment. I saw one sold who had lost two toes from each foot. No
public inquiries were made, and no explanation given. He replied to
questions that his feet "hurt him sometimes," and was bid off at
$625&mdash;about two-thirds of his value had it not been for the "defect."</p>

<p>Some slaves upon the block&mdash;especially the mothers&mdash;looked sad and
anxious; but three out of four appeared careless and unconcerned,
laughing and jesting with each other, both before and after the sale.
The young people, especially, often seemed in the best of spirits.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Most Revolting Spectacle.</div>

<p>And yet, though familiarity partially deadened the feeling produced
by the first one I witnessed, a slave auction is the most utterly
revolting spectacle that I ever looked upon. Its odiousness does not
lie in the lustful glances and expressions which a young and comely
woman on the block always elicits; nor in the indelicate conversation
and handling to which she is subjected; nor in the universal infusion
of white blood, which tells its own story about the morality of the
institution; nor in the separation of families; nor in the sale of
women&mdash;as white as our own mothers and sisters&mdash;made pariahs by
an imperceptible African taint; nor in the scars and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
"defects," suggestive of cruelty, which are sometimes seen.</p>

<p>All these features are bad enough, but many sales exhibit few
of them, and are conducted decorously. The great revolting
characteristic lies in the essence of the system itself&mdash;that claim
of absolute ownership in a human being with an immortal soul&mdash;of the
right to buy and sell him like a horse or a bale of cotton&mdash;which
insults Democracy, belies Civilization, and blasphemes Christianity.</p>

<p>In March, there was a heavy snow-storm in New York. Telegraphic
intelligence of it reached me in an apartment fragrant with
orange blossoms, where persons in linen clothing were discussing
strawberries and ice-cream. It made one shiver in that delicious,

<div class="sidenote">Northerners and the Minute Men.</div>

<p>Nearly every northerner whom I heard of in the South, as suffering
from the suspicion of Abolitionism, was really a pro-slavery man,
who had been opposing the Abolitionists all his life. I recollect
an amusing instance of a man, originally from a radical little
town in Massachusetts, who had been domiciled for several years in
Mississippi. While in New England, during the campaign after which
Mr. Lincoln was elected, he expressed pro-slavery sentiments so
odious that he was with difficulty protected from personal violence.</p>

<p>He was fully persuaded in his heart of hearts of the divinity of
Slavery; and, I doubt not, willing to fight for it. But his northern
birth made him an object of suspicion; and, immediately after the
outbreak of Secession, the inexorable Minute Men waited upon him,
inviting him, if he wished to save his life, to prepare to quit the
State in one hour. He was compelled to leave behind property to the
amount of twenty thousand dollars. His case was one of many.</p>

<p>Even from a Rebel standpoint, there was an unpleasant injustice about
this. Perhaps Democrats were almost the only northerners now in the
South&mdash;Republicans and Abolitionists staying away, in the exercise of
that discretion which is the better part of valor.</p>

<p>I well remember thinking, as I strolled down to the post-office one
evening, with a long letter in my pocket, which gave a minute and
bitterly truthful description of the slave auctions: </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Lively Discussion.</div>

<p>"If the Minute Men were to pounce upon me now, and find this
dispatch, no amount of plausible talking could save me. There would
be a vacancy on <cite>The Tribune</cite> staff within the next hour."</p>

<p>But when the message was safely deposited in the letter-box, I
experienced a sort of relief in the feeling that if the Rebels were
now to mob or imprison me, I should at least have the satisfaction
of knowing they were not mistaking souls; and that, if I were forced
to emulate Saint Paul in "labors more abundant, in stripes above
measure, in pains more frequent, in deaths oft," I should, in their
code, most richly have earned martyrdom.</p>

<p class="quotdate"><span class="smcap">New Orleans</span>, <i>March 17, 1861</i>.</p>

<p>Yesterday was a lively day in the Convention. Mr. Bienvenu threw
a hot shot into the Secession camp, in the shape of an ordinance
demanding a report of the official vote in each parish (county) by
which the delegates were elected. This would prove that the popular
vote of the State was against immediate Secession by a majority of
several hundred. The Convention would not permit such exposure of its
defiance of the popular will; and, by seventy-three to twenty-two,
refused to consider the question.</p>

<p>A warm discussion ensued, on the ordinance for submitting the
"Constitution of the Confederate States of America" to the popular
vote, for ratification or rejection. The ablest argument against it
was by Thomas J. Semmes, of New Orleans, formerly attorney-general of
Louisiana. He is a keen, wiry-looking, spectacled gentleman, who, in
a terse, incisive speech, made the best of a bad cause. The pith of
his argument was, that Republican Governments are not based upon pure
Democracy, but upon what Mr. Calhoun termed "concurring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
majorities." The voters had delegated full powers to the Convention,
which was the "sublimated, concentrated quintessence of the
sovereignty of the people."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Boldness of Union Members.</div>

<p>The speaker's lip curled with ineffable scorn as he rang the changes
upon the words "mere numerical majorities." Just now, this is a
favorite phrase with the Rebels throughout the South. Yet they all
admit that a majority, even of one vote, in Mississippi or Virginia,
justly controls the action of the State, and binds the minority.
I wish they would explain why a "mere numerical majority" is more
oppressive in a collection of States than in a single commonwealth.</p>

<p>Mr. Add Rozier, of New Orleans, in a bold speech, advocated
submitting the constitution to the people. On being asked by a
member&mdash;"Did you vote for the Secession ordinance several weeks ago?"
he replied, emphatically:&mdash;</p>

<p>"No; and, so help me God, I never will!"</p>

<p>A spontaneous outburst of applause from the lobby gave an index
of the stifled public sentiment. Mr. Rozier charged that the
Secessionists knew they were acting against the popular will, and
dared not appeal to the people. Until the Montgomery constitution
should become the law of the land, he utterly spurned it, spat upon
it, trampled it under his feet.</p>

<p>Mr. Christian Roselius, also of this city, advocated the ordinance
with equal boldness and fervor. He insisted that it was based on
the fundamental principle of Republicanism&mdash;that this Convention
was no Long Parliament to rule Louisiana without check or limit;
and he ridiculed with merciless sarcasm Mr. Semmes's theory of the
"sublimated, concentrated quintessence of the sovereignty of the
people."</p>

<p>The inexorable majority here cut off debate, calling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
the previous question, and defeated the ordinance by a vote of
seventy-three to twenty-six.</p>

<p>This body is a good specimen of the Secession Oligarchy. It
appointed, from its own members, the Louisiana delegates to the
Convention of all the seceded States which framed the Montgomery
Constitution, and now it proposes to pass finally upon their action,
leaving the people quite out of sight.</p>

<p class="quotdate"><i>March 21.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Another Exciting Discussion.</div>

<p>Another exciting day in the Convention. Subject: "The adoption of
the Montgomery Constitution." Five or six Union members fought it
very gallantly, and denounced unsparingly the plan of a Cotton
Confederacy, and the South Carolina policy of trampling upon the
rights of the people. The majority made little attempt to refute
these arguments, but some of the angry members glared fiercely upon
Messrs. Roselius, Rozier, and Bienvenu, who certainly displayed
high moral and physical courage. It is easy for you in the North to
denounce Secession; but to oppose it here, as those gentlemen did,
requires more nerve than most men possess.</p>

<p>The speech of Mr. Roselius was able and bitter. This was not a
constitution; it was merely a league&mdash;a treaty of alliance. It sprung
from an audacious, unmitigated oligarchy. It was a retrogression of
six hundred years in the science of government. We were told (here
the speaker's sarcasm of manner was ludicrous and inimitable, drawing
shouts of laughter even from the leading Secessionists) that this
body represented the "sublimated, concentrated quintessence of the
sovereignty of the people!"</p>

<p>He supposed that C&aelig;sar, when he crossed the Rubicon&mdash;Augustus, when
he overthrew the Roman Republic&mdash;Cromwell,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
when he broke up the Long Parliament&mdash;Bonaparte, when he
suppressed the Council of Five Hundred at the point of the
bayonet&mdash;Louis Napoleon, when he violated his oath to the
republic, and ascended the imperial throne&mdash;were each the
"sublimated, concentrated quintessence of the sovereignty of the
people."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Secession in a Nutshell.</div>

<p>Like the most odious tyrannies of history, it preserved the forms of
liberty; but its spirit was crushed out. The Convention from which
this creature crept into light had imitated the odious government of
Spain&mdash;the only one in the world taxing exports&mdash;by levying an export
duty upon cotton. He was surprised that the Montgomery legislators
failed to introduce a second Spanish feature&mdash;the Inquisition. One
was as detestable as the other.</p>

<p>Mr. Roselius concluded in a broken voice and with great feeling. His
heart grew sad at this overthrow of free institutions. The Secession
leaders had dug the grave of republican liberty, and we were called
upon to assist at the funeral! He would have no part in any such
unhallowed business.</p>

<p>Mr. Rozier, firm to the last, now offered an amendment:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>That in adopting the Montgomery Constitution, "the
   sovereign State of Louisiana <em>does expressly reserve
   the right to withdraw from the Union created by that
   Constitution, whenever, in the judgment of her citizens,
   her paramount interests may require it</em>."</p>
</div>

<p>This, of course, is Secession in a nutshell&mdash;the fundamental
principle of the whole movement. But the leaders refused to take
their own medicine, and tabled the proposition without discussion.</p>

<p>Mr. Bienvenu caused to be entered upon the journal his protest
against the action of the Convention, denouncing it as an ordinance
which "strips the people of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
their sovereignty, reduces them to a state of vassalage, and places
the destinies of the State, and of the new Republic, at the mercy of
an uncommissioned and irresponsible oligarchy."</p>

<p>The final vote was then taken, and resulted in one hundred and one
yeas to seven nays; so "the Confederate Constitution" is declared
ratified by the State of Louisiana.</p>

<p>The Revolutionists can not be charged with any lack of frankness.
<cite>The Delta</cite>, lamenting that the Virginia Convention will
not take that State out of the Union, predicts approvingly that "some
Cromwellian influence will yet disperse the Convention, and place the
Old Dominion in the Secession ranks." <cite>De Bow's Review</cite>,
a leading Secession oracle, with high pretensions to philosophy and
political economy, says, in its current issue:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"All government begins with usurpation, and is continued
   by force. Nature puts the ruling elements uppermost, and

while conversing with me this very day, "in seven years, the Southern

shall have Cuba, Central America, Mexico, and every thing west of the

Owen Lovejoy&mdash;the stanch Republican States of Wisconsin, Michigan,

<p>We are still enjoying the delights of summer. The air is fragrant

the blossoms of the orange. I

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
have just returned from a ride through the swamp&mdash;that great
cesspool of this metropolis, which generates, with the recurrence of
summer, the pestilence that walketh in darkness.</p>

<p>It is full of sights strange to northern eyes. The stagnant pools
of black and green water harmonize with the tall, ghastly dead
trees, from whose branches depend long fleeces of gray Spanish moss,
with the effect of Gothic architecture. It is used in lounges and
mattresses; but when streaming from the branches, in its native
state, reminds one of the fantastic term which the Choctaw Indians
apply to leaves&mdash;"tree-hair."</p>

<p>The weird dead trunks, the moss and the water, contrast strikingly
with the rich, bright foliage of the deciduous trees just glowing
into summer life. The balmy air makes physical existence delicious,
and diffuses a luxurious languor through the system. Remove your hat,
close your eyes, and its strong current strokes your brow lovingly
and nestles against your cheek like a pillow.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>During the last week in March, I went by the New Orleans and Great
Northern Railway to Jackson, Mississippi, where the State Convention
was in session.</p>

<p>There is not in Louisiana a hill two hundred feet high. Along the
railroad, smooth, grassy everglades give place to gloomy swamps, dark
with the gigantic cypress and the varnished leaves of the laurel.</p>

<p>On the plantations, the white one-story cabins of the negroes stood
in long double rows, near the ample porched and balconied residences
of the planters. Young sugar-cane, resembling corn two or three weeks
old, was just peering through the ground. Noble live-oaks

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
waved their drooping boughs above the fields. The Pride-of-China
tree was very abundant about the dwellings. It produces a berry on
which the birds eagerly feed, though its juice is said to intoxicate
them. As they do not wear revolvers or bowie-knives, it is rather a
harmless form of dissipation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Life in the City of Jackson.</div>

<p>Jackson was not a paradise for a man of my vocation. Containing four
or five thousand people, it was one of those delightful villages,
calling themselves cities, of which the sunny South by no means
enjoys a monopoly&mdash;where everybody knows everybody's business, and
where, upon the advent of a stranger, the entire community resolves
itself into a Committee of the Whole to learn who he is, where he
came from, and what he wants.</p>

<p>In a great metropolis, espionage was easily baffled; but in Jackson,
an unknown chiel, who looked capable of "takin' notes," to say
nothing of "prentin' 'em," was subject to constant and uncomfortable
scrutiny.</p>

<p>Contrasted with the bustle of New Orleans, existence seemed an
unbroken seventh-day rest, though a dire certainty possessed me, that
were my errand suspected, e'en Sunday would shine no Sabbath day for
me.</p>

<p>Some months later, a refugee, who had resided there, pictured
vividly to me the indignant and bewildered astonishment of the
Jacksonians, when, through a stray copy of <cite>The Tribune</cite>,
they learned that one of its correspondents had not only walked with
them, talked with them, and bought with them, but, less scrupulous
than Shylock, had been ready to eat with them, drink with them, and
pray with them.</p>

<p>At this time the Charleston papers and some northern journals
declared <cite>The Tribune's</cite> southern correspondence fictitious, and
manufactured at the home office. To

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
remove that impression touching my own letters, I wrote, on certain
days, the minutest records of the Convention, and of affairs in
Jackson, which never found their way into the local prints.</p>

<p>Mournfully metropolitan was Jackson in one respect&mdash;the price of
board at its leading hotel. The accommodations were execrable;
but I suppose we were charged for the unusual luxury of an
unctuous Teutonic landlord, who bore the formidable patronymic of
H-i-l-z-h-e-i-m-e-r!</p>

chance acquaintance, kindly invited me to a chair beside his desk,
and as I sat facing the members, explained to me their capacity,
views, and antecedents. Whether an undue inquisitiveness seemed to
him the distinguishing quality of the New Mexican mind, he did not
declare; but once he asked me abruptly if I was connected with the
press? With the least possible delay, I disabused his mind of that
peculiarly unjust misapprehension.</p>

<p>After a long discussion, the Convention, by a vote of fifty-three to
thirty-two, refused to submit the Constitution to the people, and
ratified it in the name of Mississippi. Seven Union members could
not be induced to follow the usual practice of making the action
unanimous, but to the last steadfastly refused their adherence. </p>

   <span class="smcap">The Mississippi State House.</span>
</div>

<p>The Mississippi State House, upon a shaded square in front of my
window, is a faded, sober edifice, of the style in vogue fifty years
ago, with the representative hall at one end, the senate chamber at
the other, an Ionic portico in front, and an immense dome upon the
top. Above this is a miniature dome, like an infinitesimal parasol
upon a gigantic umbrella. The whole is crowned by a small gilded
pinnacle, which has relapsed from its original perpendicular to an
angle of forty-five degrees, and looks like a little jockey-cap, worn
jantily upon the head of a plethoric quaker, to whom it imparts a
rowdyish air, at variance with his general gravity.</p>

<p>The first story is of cracked free-stone, the front and end walls of
stucco, and the rear of brick. As you enter the vestibule two musty
cannon stand gaping at you, and upon one of them you may see, almost
any day, a little "darkey" sound asleep. Whether he guards the gun,
or the gun guards him, opens a wide field for conjecture.</p>

<p>Ascending a spiral stairway, and passing along the balustrade which
surrounds the open space under the dome, you turn to the left,
through a narrow passage into the representative hall. Here is the
Mississippi Convention.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <span class="smcap">View of the Rep&shy;resen&shy;tative Hall.</span>
</div>

<p>At the north end of the apartment sits the president,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
upon a high platform occupying a recess in the wall, with two Ionic
columns upon each side of him. Before him is a little, old-fashioned
mahogany pulpit, concealing all but his head and shoulders from the
vulgar gaze. In front of this, and three or four feet lower, at a
long wooden desk, sit two clerks, one smoking a cigar.</p>

<p>Before them, and still lower, at a shorter desk, an unhappy Celtic
reporter, with dark shaggy hair and eyebrows, is taking down the
speech of the honorable member from something or other county. In
front of his desk, standing rheumatically upon the floor, is a little
table, which looks as if called into existence by a drunken carpenter
on a dark night, from the relics of a superannuated dry-goods box.</p>

<p>Upon one of the columns at the president's right, hangs a faded
portrait of George Poindexter, once a senator from this State.
Further to the right is an open fire-place, upon whose mantel stand a
framed copy of the Declaration of Independence, now sadly faded and
blurred, a lithographic view of the Medical College of Louisiana, and
a pitcher and glass. On the hearth is a pair of ancient andirons,
upon which a genial wood fire is burning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General Air of Dilapidation.</div>

<p>The hypocritical plastering which coated the fireplace has peeled
off, leaving bare the honest, worn faces of the original bricks. Some
peculiar non-adhesive influence must affect plastering in Jackson. In
whole rooms of the hotel it has seceded from the lath. Judge Gholson
says that once, in the old State House, a few hundred yards distant,
when <del>Sargeant</del><ins>Seargeant</ins> S. Prentiss was making a
speech, he saw "an acre or two" of the plastering fall upon his head,
and quite overwhelm him for the time. The Judge is what Count Fosco
would call the Man of Brains; he is deemed the ablest member

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
of the Convention. He was a colleague in Congress of the lamented
Prentiss, whom he pronounces the most brilliant orator that ever
addressed a Mississippi audience.</p>

<p>On the left of the president is another fire-place, also with a sadly
blurred copy of the great Declaration standing upon its mantel. The
members' desks, in rows like the curved line of the letter D, are
of plain wood, painted black. Their chairs are great, square, faded
mahogany frames, stuffed and covered with haircloth. As you stand
beside the clerk's desk, facing them, you see behind the farthest
row a semi-circle of ten pillars, and beyond them a narrow, crescent
shaped lobby. Half-way up the pillars is a little gallery, inhabited
just now by two ladies in faded mourning.</p>

<p>In the middle of the hall, a tarnished brass chandelier, with
pendants of glass, is suspended from the ceiling by a rod festooned
with cobwebs. This medieval relic is purely ornamental, for the room
is lighted with gas. The walls are high, pierced with small windows,
whose faded blue curtains, flowered and bordered with white, are
suspended from a triple bar of gilded Indian arrows.</p>

<p>Chairs of cane, rush, wood and leather seats&mdash;chairs with backs, and
chairs without backs, are scattered through the hall and lobby, in
pleasing illustration of that variety which is the spice of life. The
walls are faded, cracked, and dingy, pervaded by the general air of
mustiness, and going to "the demnition bow-wows" prevalent about the
building.</p>

<p>The members are in all sorts of social democratic positions. In the
open spaces about the clerk's desk and fire-places, some sit with
chairs tilted against the wall, some upon stools, and three slowly
vibrate to and fro in pre-Raphaelite

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
rocking-chairs. These portions of the hall present quite the
appearance of a Kentucky bar-room on a winter evening.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Free and Easy Convention.</div>

<p>Two or three members are eating apples, three or four smoking cigars,
and a dozen inspect their feet, resting upon the desks before them.
Contemplating the spectacle yesterday, I found myself involuntarily
repeating the couplet of an old temperance ditty:</p>

<div class="poem">

</div>

<p class="continued">and a moment after I was strongly

you, if you did not know it before, that there are not many large

of wonder at their immense size and stature. Of them the future
historian may well say: "There were giants in those days."</p>

<p>All around you are broad-shouldered, herculean-framed,
well-proportioned men, who look as if a laugh from them would bring
this crazy old capitol down about their ears, and a sneeze, shake

<p>The members, like all deliberative bodies in this latitude, are
mutual admirationists. Every speaker has the most profound respect
for the honest motives, the pure patriotism, the transcendent
abilities of the honorable gentleman upon the other side. It excites
his regret and self-distrust to differ from such an array of learning
and eloquence; and nothing could impel him to but a sense of
imperious duty.</p>

<p>He speaks fluently, and with grammatical correctness, but in
the Anglo-African dialect. His violent denunciations of the Black
Republicans are as nothing to the gross indignities which he offers
to the letter <em>r</em>. His "<em>mo's</em>," "<em>befo's</em>,"
and "<em>hea's</em>" convey reminiscences of the negress who nursed
him in infancy, and the little "pickaninnies" with whom he played in
boyhood.</p>

<p>The custom of stump-speaking, universal through the South and
West, is a capital factory for converting the raw material into
orators. Of course there are strong exceptions. This very morning
we had an address from one member&mdash;Mr. D. B. Moore, of Tuppah
county&mdash;which

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
is worthy of more particular notice. I wish I could give you a
literal report. Pickwick would be solemn in comparison.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Speech worth Preservation.</div>

<p>Mr. Moore conceives himself an orator, as Brutus was; but in
attempting to cover the whole subject (the Montgomery Constitution),
he spread himself out "very thin." I will "back" him in a given time
to quote more Scripture, incorrectly, irreverently, and irrelevantly,
than any other man on the North American continent.</p>

<p>His "like we" was peculiarly refreshing, and his history and
classics had a strong flavor of originality. He quoted Patrick
Henry, "<em>Let</em> C&aelig;sar have his Brutus;" piled "Pelion
upon <em>Pelion</em>!" and made Sampson kill Goliah!! He thought
submitting the Secession ordinance to the people in Texas had
produced an excellent effect. Previous to it, the <cite>New York
Tribune</cite> said: "Secession is but a scheme of demagogues&mdash;a
move on the political chess-board&mdash;the people oppose it." But
afterward it began to ask: "How is this? What does it all mean? The
people seem to have a hand in it, and to be in earnest, too." The
tone of Mr. Seward also changed radically, he observed, after that
election.</p>

<p>Mr. Moore spoke an hour and a half, and the other members, though
listening courteously, betrayed a lurking suspicion that he was a
bore. In person he resembles Henry S. Lane, the zealous United States
Senator-elect from Indiana. The sergeant-at-arms, who, in a gray
coat, and without a neckerchief, walks to and fro, with hands in his
pockets, looks like the unlovely James H. Lane, Senator-expectant
from Kansas.</p>

<p>The Second Louisiana Zouaves were reviewed on Lafayette Square last
evening, before leaving for Pensacola. They are boyish-looking, and
handle their muskets as if a little afraid of them, but seem to be
the raw material of good soldiers. They are luridly grotesque, in
closely-fitting, blue-tasseled, red fez caps, blue flannel jackets
and frocks, faced with red, baggy red breeches, like galvanized
corn-sacks, and gutta-percha greaves about their ankles.</p>

<p>All the Secession leaders except Senator Benjamin declare there will
be no war. He asserts that war is sure to come; and in a recent
speech characterized it as "by no means an unmixed evil."</p>

<p>The Fire-Eaters are intensely bitter upon the border States for
refusing to plunge into the whirlpool of Secession. They are bent
on persuading or driving all the slave States into their ranks.
Otherwise they fear&mdash;indeed, predict frankly&mdash;that the
border will gradually become Abolitionized, and extend free territory
to the Gulf itself. They are quite willing to devote Kentucky and
Virginia to the devastation of civil war, or the embarrassment of a
contiguous hostile republic, which would not return their run-away

<p>The recent warlike movements of the National Government cause
excitement and surprise. At last, the people begin to suspect that
they have invoked grim-visaged war. The newspapers descant upon the
injury to commerce and industry. Why did they not think of all this
before?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Three Obnoxious Northerners.</div>

<p>It is vouchsafed to few mortals to learn, before death, exactly what
their associates think of them; but your correspondent is among
the favored few. The other evening, I was sitting with a Secession
acquaintance, in the great exchange of the St. Charles Hotel, when
conversation turned upon the southern habit of lynching people who
do not happen to agree with the majority. He presumed enough upon my
ignorance to insist that any moderate, gentlemanly Republican might
come here with impunity.</p>

<p>"But," he added, "there are three men whose safety I would not
guarantee."</p>

<p>"Who are they?"</p>

<p>"Governor Dennison, of Ohio, is one. Since he refused to return that
fugitive slave to Kentucky, he would hardly be permitted to stay in
New Orleans; at all events, I should oppose it. Then there is Andy
Johnson. He ought to be shot, or hanged, wherever found. But for him,
Kentucky and Tennessee would have been with us long ago. He could not
remain here unharmed for a single hour."</p>

<p>"And the third?"</p>

<p>"Some infernal scoundrel, who is writing abusive letters about us to
<cite>The New York Tribune</cite>."</p>

<p>"Is it possible?" </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and he has been at it for more than a month."</p>

<p>"Can't you find him out?"</p>

<p>"Some think it is a Kentuckian, who pretends to be engaged in
cattle-trading, but only makes that a subterfuge. I suspect, however,
that it is an editor of <cite>The Picayune</cite>, which is a Yankee
concern through and through. If he is caught, I don't think he will
write many more letters."</p>

<p>I ventured a few words in palliation of the Governor and the Senator,
but quite agreed that this audacious scribbler ought to be suppressed.</p>

<p class="quotdate"><i>April 12.</i></p>

<p>Telegraphic intelligence to-day of the attack upon Fort Sumter
causes intense excitement. <cite>The Delta</cite> office is besieged
by a crowd hungry for news. The universal expectation of the easy
capture of the fort is not stronger than the belief that it will be
followed by an immediate and successful movement against the city of
Washington. The politicians and newspapers have persuaded the masses
that the Yankees (a phrase which they no longer apply distinctively
to New Englanders, but to every person born in the North) mean to
subjugate them, but are arrant cowards, who may easily be frightened
away. Leading men seldom express this opinion; yet <cite>The
Crescent</cite>, giving the report that eight thousand Massachusetts
troops have been called into the field, adds, that if they would come
down to Pensacola, eighteen hundred Confederates would easily "whip
them out."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Abolition Tendencies of Kentuckians.</div>

<p>There were two of my acquaintances (one very prominent in the
Secession movement) with whom, while they had no suspicion of my
real business, I could converse with a little frankness. One of them
desired war, on the ground that it would unite the inhabitants of all
the border slave States, and overpower the Union sentiment there.</p>

<p>"But," I asked, "will not war also unite the people of the North?"</p>

<p>"I think not. We have a great many earnest and bold friends there."</p>

<p>"True; but do you suppose they could stand for a single week against
the popular feeling which war would arouse?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right," he replied, thoughtfully, "but it never
occurred to me before."</p>

<p>My other friend also talked with great frankness:</p>

<p>"We can get along very well with the New England Yankees who are
permanently settled here. They make the strongest Secessionists we
have; but the Kentuckians give us a great deal of trouble. They were
born and raised where Slavery is unprofitable. They have strong
proclivities toward Abolitionism. The constituents of Rozier and
Roselius, who fought us so persistently in the Convention, are nearly
all Kentuckians. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Two Chief Causes of Secession.</div>

<p>"Slavery is our leading interest. Right or wrong, we have it and
we must have it. Cotton, rice, and sugar cannot be raised without
it. Being a necessity, we do not mean to allow its discussion.
Every thing which clashes with it, or tends to weaken it, must go
under. Our large German population is hostile to it. About all these
Dutchmen would be not only Unionists, but Black Republicans, if they
dared."</p>

<p>Perhaps it is the invariable law of revolutions that, even while the
revolters are in a numerical minority, they are able to carry the
majority with them. It is certain that, before Sumter was fired on,
a majority in every State, except South Carolina, was opposed to
Secession. The constant predictions of the Rebel leaders that there
would be no war, and the assertions of prominent New York journals,
that any attempt at coercion on the part of the Government would
be met with armed and bloody resistance in every northern city and
State, were the two chief causes of the apparent unanimity of the
South.</p>

<p>The masses had a vague but very earnest belief that the North,
in some incomprehensible manner, had done them deadly wrong.
Cassio-like, they remembered "a mass of things, but nothing
distinctly; a quarrel, but nothing wherefore." The leaders were
sometimes more specific.</p>

<p>"The South," said a pungent writer, "has endured a great many wrongs;
but the most intolerable of all the grievances ever thrust upon her
was the Census Report of 1860!" There was a great deal of truth in
this remark. One day I asked my New Orleans friend:</p>

<p>"Why have you raised all this tempest about Mr. Lincoln's election?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fundamental Grievance of the Rebels.</div>

<p>"Don't deceive yourself," he answered. "Mr. Lincoln's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
election had nothing to do with it, beyond enabling us to rouse our
people. Had Douglas been chosen, we should have broken up the Union
just as quickly. Had Bell triumphed, it would have been all the
same. Even if Breckinridge had been elected, we would have seceded
before the close of his term. There is an essential incompatibility
between the two sections. <em>The South stands still, while the North
has grown rich and powerful, and expanded from ocean to ocean.</em>"</p>

<p>This was the fundamental grievance. Very liberal in his general
views, he had not apparently the faintest suspicion that Slavery was
responsible for the decadence of the South, or that Freedom impelled
the gigantic strides of the North.</p>

<p>Yet his theory of the Rebellion was doubtless correct. It arose
from no man, or party, or political event, but from the inherent
quarrel between two adverse systems, which the fullness of time
had ripened into open warfare. His "essential incompatibility" was
only another name for Mr. Seward's "Irrepressible Conflict" between
two principles. They have since recorded, in letters of blood, not
merely their incompatibility, but their absolute, aggressive, eternal
antagonism.</p>

<p>During the second week in April, I began to find myself the object of
unpleasant, not to say impertinent, curiosity. So many questions were
asked, so many pointed and significant remarks made in my presence,
as to render it certain that I was regarded with peculiar suspicion.</p>

<p>At first I was at a loss to surmise its origin. But one day I
encountered an old acquaintance in the form of a son of Abraham,
who had frequently heard me, in public addresses in Kansas, utter
sentiments not absolutely pro-slavery;

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
who knew that I once held a modest commission in the Free State army,
and that I was a whilom correspondent of <cite>The Tribune</cite>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sudden Departure from New Orleans.</div>

<p>He was by no means an Israelite without guile, for he had been
chased out of the Pike's Peak region during the previous summer,
for robbing one of my friends who had nursed him in sickness.
Concluding that he might play the informer, I made an engagement
with him for the next afternoon, and, before the time arrived, shook
from my feet the dust of New Orleans. Designing to make a <span
lang="fr">d&eacute;tour</span> to Fort Pickens on my way, I procured
a ticket for Washington. The sea was the safer route, but I was
curious to take a final look at the interior.</p>

<p>On Friday evening, April 12th, I left the Crescent City. In five
minutes our train plunged into the great swamp which environs the
commercial metropolis of the Southwest. Deep, broad ditches are cut
for draining, and you sometimes see an alligator, five or six feet
long, and as large as the body of a man, lying lazily upon the edge
of the green water.</p>

<p>The marshy ground is mottled with gorgeous flowers, and the palmetto
is very abundant. It does not here attain to the dignity of a tree,
seldom growing more than four feet high. Its flag, sword-shaped
leaves branch out in flat semicircular clusters, resembling the fan
palm. Its tough bulbous root was formerly cut into fine fragments
by the Indians, then bruised to a pulp and thrown into the lake. It
produced temporary blindness among the fishes, which brought them to
the surface, where they were easily caught by hand.</p>

<p>With rare fitness stands the palmetto as the device of South
Carolina. Indeed, it is an excellent emblem of Slavery itself; for,
neither beautiful, edible, nor useful, it blinds the short-sighted
fish coming under its influence. </p>

<p>A ride of four miles brought us to Lake Pontchartrain, stretching
away in the fading sunlight. Over the broad expanse of swelling
water, delicate, foamy white caps were cresting the waves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The War Spirit in Mobile.</div>

<p>We were transferred to the propeller Alabama, and, when I woke the
next morning, were lying at Mobile. With a population of thirty
thousand, the city contains many pleasant residences, embowered in
shade-trees, and surrounded by generous grounds. It is rendered
attractive by its tall pines, live oak, and Pride-of-China trees. The
last were now decked in a profusion of bluish-white blossoms.</p>

<p>The war spirit ran high. Hand-bills, headed "Soldiers wanted," and
"Ho! for volunteers," met the eye at every corner; uniforms and arms
abounded, and the voice of the bugle was heard in the streets. All
northern vessels were clearing on account of the impending crisis,
though some were not more than half loaded.</p>

<p>Mobile was very radical. One of the daily papers urged the imposition
of a tax of one dollar per copy upon every northern newspaper or
magazine brought into the Confederacy!</p>

<p>The leading hotel was crowded with guests, including many soldiers
<span lang="la">en route</span> for Bragg's army. It was my own
design to leave for Pensacola that evening, and look at the possible
scene of early hostilities. A Secession friend in New Orleans had
given me a personal letter to General Bragg, introducing me as a
gentleman of leisure, who would be glad to make a few sketches of
proper objects of interest about his camps, for one of the New York
illustrated papers. It added that he had known

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
me all his life, and vouched completely for my "soundness."</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <span class="smcap">Suspicions Aroused&mdash;an Awkward Encounter.</span>
</div>

<p>But a little incident changed my determination. Among my
fellow-passengers from New Orleans were three young officers of the
Confederate army, also bound for Fort Pickens. While on the steamer,
I did not observe that I was an object of their special attention;
but just after breakfast this morning, as I was going up to my room,
in the fourth story of the Battle House, I encountered them also
ascending the broad stairs. The moment they saw me, they dropped the
subject upon which they were conversing, and one, with significant
glances, burst into a most violent invective against <cite>The
Tribune</cite>, denouncing it as the vilest journal in America,
except Parson Brownlow's <cite>Knoxville Whig!</cite> pronouncing
every man connected with it a thief and scoundrel, and asserting that
if any of its correspondents could be caught here, they would be hung
upon the nearest tree.</p>

<p>This philippic was so evidently inspired by my presence, and the eyes
of the whole group glared with a speculation so unpleasant, that I
felt myself an unhappy Romeo, "too early seen unknown and known too
late." I had learned by experience that the best protection for a
suspected man was to go everywhere, as if he had a right to go; to
brave scrutiny; to return stare for stare and question for question.</p>

<p>So, during this tirade, which lasted while, side by side, we
leisurely climbed two staircases, I strove to maintain an exterior
of serene and wooden unconsciousness. When the speaker had exhausted
his vocabulary of hard words, I drew a fresh cigar from my pocket,
and said to him, "Please to give me a light, sir." With a puzzled
air he took his cigar from his mouth, knocked off the ashes with
his forefinger, handed it to me, and stood regarding

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
me a little curiously, while, looking him full in the face, I slowly
ignited my own Havana, returned his, and thanked him.</p>

<p>They turned away apparently convinced that their zeal had outrun
their discretion. The look of blank disappointment and perplexity
upon the faces of those young officers as they disappeared in the
passage will be, to me, a joy forever.</p>

<p>Pondering in my room upon fresh intelligence of the arrest of
suspicious persons in General Bragg's camp, and upon this little
experience, I changed my plan. As Toodles, in the farce, thinks he
"won't smoke," so I decided not to go to Pensacola; but ordered a
carriage, and drove down to the mail-boat St. Charles, which was to
leave for Montgomery that evening.</p>

<p>I fully expected during the afternoon to entertain a vigilance
committee, the police, or some military officials who would invite
me to look at Secession through prison bars. It was not an inviting
prospect; yet there was nothing to do but to wait.</p>

<p>The weather was dreamy and delicious. My state-room looked out upon
the shining river, and the rich olive green of the grassy shore. Upon
the dull, opaque water of a broad bayou beyond, little snowy sails
flashed, and a steamer, with tall black chimneys, left a white, foamy
track in the waters, and long clouds of brown smoke against the sky.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"Mass'r, Fort Sumter's Gone up!"</div>

<p>At three o'clock in the afternoon, while I was lying in my
state-room, looking out drowsily upon this picture, a cabin-boy
presented his sooty face at the door and said, "Mass'r, Fort Sumter's
gone up!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bells Ringing and Cannons Booming.</div>

<p>The intelligence had just arrived by telegraph. The first battle of
the Great War was over, and seventy-two men, after a bombardment
of two days, were captured

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
by twelve thousand! In a moment church and steamboat bells rang out
their notes of triumph, and cannon belched forth their deep-mouthed
exultation. A public meeting was extemporized in the street, and
enthusiastic speeches were made. Mindful of my morning experience,
I did not leave the boat, but tried to read the momentous Future.
I thought I could see, in its early pages, the death-warrant of
Slavery; but all else was inscrutable.</p>

<p>There was a steam calliope attached to the "St. Charles." That
evening, when the last bell had rung, and the last cable was taken
in, she left the Mobile landing, and plowed slowly up the river
to the shrill notes of "Dixie's Land."<a name="FNanchor_6_6"
id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>The Alabama is the "most monotonously beautiful of rivers." In the
evening twilight, its sinuous sweep afforded a fine view of both
shores, timbered down to the water's edge. Dense foliage, decked in
the blended and intermingled hues of summer, gave them the appearance
of two soft, smooth cushions of variegated velvet.</p>

<p>After dark, we met the descending mail-boat. Our calliope saluted
her with lively music, and the passengers assembled on the guards,
greeting each other with the usual huzzas and waving of hats and
handkerchiefs. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>On Sunday morning, the inevitable calliope awoke us&mdash;this time,
with sacred music. At many river landings there was only a single
well-shaded farm-house on the bank, with ladies sitting upon the
piazzas, and white and negro children playing under the magnificent
live-oaks. At others, a solitary warehouse stood upon the high,
perpendicular bluff, with an inclined-plane railway for the
conveyance of freight to the water. At some points the country was
open, and a great cotton-field extended to the river-bank, with a
weather-beaten cotton-press in the midst of it, like an old northern
cider-mill.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <span class="smcap">A Terp&shy;si&shy;chorean Young Negro.</span>
</div>

<p>Planters, returning from New Orleans and Mobile, were met at the
landings by their negroes. The slaves appeared glad to see them, and
were greeted with hearty hand-shakings. At one landing the calliope
struck up a lively strain, and a young darkey on the bank, with
the Terpsichorean proclivity of his race, began to dance as if for
dear life, throwing his arms and legs in ludicrous and extravagant
fashion. His master attempted to cuff his ears, but the little
fellow ducked his head and danced away, to the great merriment of
the lookers-on. The negro nurses on the boat fondled and kissed the
little white children in their charge most ardently.</p>

<p>I saw no instance of unkind treatment to slaves; but a young planter
on board mentioned to me, as a noteworthy circumstance, that he had
not permitted a negro to be struck upon his plantation for a year.</p>

<p>A Texian on board the boat was very bitter against Governor Houston,
and, with the usual extreme language of the Rebels, declared he
would be hanged if he persisted in opposing the Disunionists. An old
citizen of Louisiana, too, became so indignant at me for remarking I
had always supposed Douglas to sympathize with the South, that I made
haste to qualify the assertion. </p>

<p>Our passengers were excellent specimens of the better class of
southerners. Aside from his negrophobia, the southern <em>gentleman</em>
is an agreeable companion. He is genial, frank, cordial, profoundly
deferential to women, and carries his heart in his hand. His social
qualities are his weak point. To a northerner, passing through his
country during these disjointed times, I would have said:</p>

<p>"Your best protection is to be 'hail fellow, well met;' spend money
freely, tell good stories, be liberal of your private brandy-flask,
and your after-dinner cigars. If you do this, and your manners are,
in his thinking, gentlemanly, he can by no means imagine you a Yankee
in the offensive sense. He pictures all Yankees as puritanic, rigid,
fanatical, and talking through the nose. 'What the world wants,' says
George William Curtis, 'is not honesty, but acquiescence.' That is
profoundly true here. Acquiesce gracefully, not intemperately, in the
prevailing sentiment. Don't hail from the State of Massachusetts;
don't 'guess,' or use other northern provincialisms; don't make
yourself conspicuous&mdash;and, if you know human nature, you may pass
without serious trouble."</p>

<p>Our southerner has little humanity&mdash;he feels little sympathy for a
man, <em>as</em> a man&mdash;as a mere human being&mdash;but he has abundant warmth
toward his own social class. Not a very high specimen himself, he
yet lays infinite stress upon being "a gentleman." If you have the
misfortune to be poor, and without credentials, but possess the
manners of education and good society, he will give you kinder
reception than you are likely to obtain in the bustling, restless,
crowded North.</p>

college, I remarked that men were seldom found in any circle who had
not some sympathy or affinity with it, to stimulate them to seek it.
"Yes," he replied, "something to <em>aig them on</em>!"</p>

<p>The forests along the river were beautiful with the brilliant green
live-oak festooned with mistletoe, the dark pine, the dense cane,
the spring glory of the cottonwood and maple, the drooping delicate
leaves of the willow, the white-stemmed sycamore with its creamy
foliage, and the great snowy blossoms of the dog-wood.</p>

<p>With a calliope, familiarity breeds contempt. Ours became an
intolerable nuisance, and induced frequent discussions about bribing
the player to stop it. He was apparently animated by the spirit of
the Parisian who set a hand-organ to running by clockwork in his
room, locked the apartment, went to the country for a month, and,
when he returned, found that two obnoxious neighbors, whom he wished
to drive away, had blown out their brains in utter despair.</p>

<p>While I was pleasantly engaged in a whist-party in the cabin, this
fragment of a conversation between two bystanders reached my ears: </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>"A spy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a spy from the North, looking about to obtain information for
old Lincoln; and they arrested one yesterday, too."</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <span class="smcap">Con&shy;fed&shy;erate Capitol at Mont&shy;gomery.</span>
</div>

<p>This was a pleasing theme of reflection for the timid and
contemplative mind. A passenger explained the matter, by informing
me that, at one of the landings where we stopped, telegraphic
intelligence was received of the arrest of two spies at Montgomery.
The popular impression seemed to be, that about one person in ten was
engaged in that not-very-fascinating avocation!</p>

<p>In Indian dialect, Alabama signifies, "Here we rest;" but, for me,
it had an exactly opposite meaning. We awoke one morning to find
our boat lying at Montgomery. Reaching the hotel too early for
breakfast, I strolled with a traveler from Philadelphia, a pretended
Secessionist, to the State House, which was at present also the
Capitol of the Confederacy.</p>

<p>Standing, like the Capitol in Washington, at the head of a broad
thoroughfare, it overlooks a pleasant city of eight thousand people.
The building is of stucco, and bears that melancholy suggestion of
better days which seems inseparable from the Peculiar Institution.</p>

<p>The senate chamber is a small, dingy apartment, on whose dirty
walls hang portraits of Clay, Calhoun, and two or three Alabama
politicians. The desks and chairs were covered with antiquated public
documents, and the other <span lang="la">d&eacute;bris</span> of
legislative halls. While returning to the hotel, we heard from a
street loafer a terse description of some model slave:</p>

<p>"He is just the best nigger in this town. He knows enough to work
well, and he knows nothing else."</p>

<p>We were also informed that the Virginia Convention had passed a
Secession ordinance. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is capital news; is it not?" said my Philadelphia companion,
with well-assumed glee.</p>

<p>For several days, in spite of his violent assertions, I had doubted
his sincerity. This was the first time he broached the subject when
no one else was present. I looked steadily in his eye, and inquired:</p>

<p>"Do you think so?"</p>

<p>His half-quizzical expression was a satisfactory answer, even without
the reply:</p>

<p>"I want to get home to Philadelphia without being detained on the
way."</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <span class="smcap">"Copperas Breeches" vs. "Black Breeches."</span>
</div>

<p>In the hotel office, two well-dressed southerners were discussing the
omnipresent topic. One of them said:</p>

<p>"We shall have no war."</p>

<p>"Yes, we shall," replied the other. "The Yankees are going to fight
for a while; but it will make no difference to us. We have got
copperas breeches enough to carry this war through. None of the black
breeches will have to shoulder muskets!"</p>

<p>The reader should understand that the clothing of the working whites
was colored with a dye in which copperas was the chief ingredient;
while, of course, the upper, slaveholding classes, wore "customary
suits of solemn black." This was a very pregnant sentence, conveying
in a few words the belief of those Rebels who instigated and impelled
the war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <span class="smcap">A Cor&shy;res&shy;pondent in Durance Vile.</span>

<p>The morning newspapers, at our breakfast-table, detailed two
interesting facts. First, that "Jasper,"<a name="FNanchor_7_7"
id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Charleston correspondent of <cite>The New York Times</cite>, had been
seized and imprisoned in the Palmetto City. Second, that Gen. Bragg
had arrested in his camp, and sent under guard to Montgomery, "as a
prisoner of war," the correspondent of <cite>The Pensacola</cite>
(Fla.) <cite>Observer</cite>. This journalist was an enthusiastic
Secessionist, but had been guilty of some indiscretion in publishing
facts touching the strength and designs of the Rebel army. His
signature was "Nemo;" and he now bade fair to be No One, indeed, for
some time to come.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>I now began to entertain sentiments of profound gratitude toward the
young officer, at Mobile, who kept me from going to Fort Pickens.
Rejecting the tempting request of my Philadelphia companion to remain
one day in Montgomery, that he might introduce me to Jefferson Davis,
I continued my "Journey Due North."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of Capturing Fort Sumter.</div>

<p>When we reached the cars, my baggage was missing. The omnibus
agent, who was originally a New Yorker, and probably thought it
precarious for a man desiring to reach Washington to be detained,
even a few hours, kindly induced the conductor to detain the train
for five minutes while we drove back to the Exchange Hotel and found
the missing valise. The event proved that delay would have been
embarrassing, if not perilous.</p>

<p>A Georgian on the car-seat with me, while very careful not to let
others overhear his remarks, freely avowed Union sentiments, and
asserted that they were predominant among his neighbors. I longed to
respond earnestly and sincerely, but there was the possibility of a
trap, and I merely acquiesced.</p>

<p>The country was intoxicated by the capture of Sumter. A newspaper on
the train, several days old, in its regular Associated Press report,
contained the following:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Was&shy;hing&shy;ton to be Captured.</div>

<p class="quotdate">
   <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>, Ala., Friday, <i>April 12, 1861</i>.
</p>

<p>An immense crowd serenaded President Davis and Mr. Walker, Secretary
of War, at the Exchange Hotel to-night. The former was not

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
well, and did not appear. Secretary Walker, in a few words of
electrical eloquence, told the news from Fort Sumter, declaring, in
conclusion, that before many hours the flag of the Confederacy would
float over that fortress. No man, he said, could tell where the war
this day commenced would end, but he would prophesy that the flag
which here streams to the breeze would float over the dome of the old
Capitol at Washington before the first of May. Let them test Southern
courage and resources, and it might float eventually over Faneuil
Hall itself.</p>

<p>An officer from General Bragg's camp informed me that all
preparations for capturing Fort Pickens were made, the United States
sentinels on duty upon a certain night being bribed; but that
"Nemo's" intimation of the intended attack frustrated it, a copy of
his letter having found its way into the post, and forewarned and
forearmed the commander.</p>

<p>Everybody was looking anxiously for news from the North. The
predictions of certain New York papers, that the northern people
would inaugurate war at home if the Government attempted "coercion,"
were received with entire credulity, and frequently quoted.</p>

<p>There was much admiration of Major Anderson's defense of Sumter; but
the opinion was general, that only a military sense of honor dictated
his conduct; that now, relieved from a soldier's responsibility, he
would resign and join the Rebels. "He is too brave a man to remain
with the Yankees," was the common remark. Far in the interior of
Georgia, I saw fragments of his flag-staff exhibited, and highly
prized as relics.</p>

<p>We dined at the little hamlet of West Point, on the line between
Alabama and Georgia, and stopped for two evening hours at the
bustling city of Atlanta. Our stay was enlivened by a fresh
conversation in the car about northern spies and reporters, who were
declared to be infesting the country, and worthy of hanging wherever
found. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <span class="smcap">Appre&shy;hension about Arming the Negroes.</span>
</div>

<p>We spent the night in pursuit of sleep under difficulties, upon
a rough Georgia railway. The next morning, the scantiness of the
disappearing foliage indicated that we were going northward. In
Augusta, we passed through broad, pleasant shaded streets, and then
crossed the Savannah river into South Carolina. Companies of troops,
bound for Charleston, began to come on board the train, and were
greeted with cheering at all the stations. A young Carolinian, taking
me for a southerner, remarked:</p>

<p>"The only thing we fear in this war is that the Yankees will arm our
slaves and turn them against us."</p>

<p>This was the first statement of the kind I heard. Persons had said
many times in my presence that they were perfectly sure of the
slaves&mdash;who would all fight for their masters. In the last article
of faith they proved as deluded as those sanguine northerners who
believed that slave insurrections would everywhere immediately result
from hostilities.</p>

<p>At Lee's Station we met the morning train from Charleston. Within
two yards of my window, I saw a dark object disappear under the
cow-catcher; and a moment after, a woman, wringing her hands,
shrieked:</p>

<p>"My God! My God! Mr. Lee killed!"</p>

<p>Lying on the track was a shapeless, gory mass, which only
the clothing showed to be the remains of a human being. The
station-keeper, attempting to cross the road just in advance
of the train, was struck down and run over. His little son was
standing beside him at the very moment, and two of his daughters
looking on from the door of his residence, a few yards away. In the
first bewilderment of terror, they now stood wildly beating their
foreheads, and gasping for breath. In strange contrast with this
scene, a martial band was

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
discoursing lively music, and people were loudly cheering the
soldiers. Buoyant Life and grim Death stood side by side and walked
hand in hand.</p>

<p>Our train plunged into deep pine woods, and wended through large
plantations, whose cool frame houses were shaded by palmetto-trees.
The negro men and women, who stood in the fields persuading
themselves that they were working, handled their hoes with
indescribable awkwardness. A sketch of their exact positions would
look ridiculously unnatural. They were in striking contrast with
the zeal and activity of the northern laborer, who moves under the
stimulus of freedom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Looking at the Captured Fortress.</div>

<p>In the afternoon, we passed through the Magnolia Cemetery, and in
view of the State Arsenal, with the palmetto flag waving over it. The
Mills' House, in Charleston, was crowded with guests and citizens,
half of them in uniform. After I registered my name, a brawny fellow,
with a "plug-ugly" countenance, looked over my shoulder at the book,
and then regarded me with a long, impudent, scrutinizing stare, which
I endeavored to return with interest. In a few seconds his eyes
dropped, and he went back to his seat.</p>

<p>I strolled down the narrow streets, with their antiquated houses, to
the pleasant Battery, where several columbiads, with pyramidal piles
of solid shot between them, pointed at Fort Sumter. Down the harbor,
among a few snow-white sails, stood the already historic fortress.
The line of broken roof, visible above the walls, was torn and ragged
from Rebel shots. At the distance of two miles, it was impossible,
with the naked eye, to identify the two flags above it. A bystander
told me that they were the colors of South Carolina and of the
Confederacy.</p>

<p>The devices of treason flaunting in the breeze where

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
the Stars and Stripes, after being insulted for months, were so
lately lowered in dishonor, were not a pleasant spectacle, and I
turned slowly and sadly back to the hotel. In its reading-room,
among the four or five papers on file, was a copy of <cite>The
Tribune</cite>, whose familiar face was like the shadow of a great
rock in a weary land.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Short Stay in Charleston.</div>

<p>The city reeled with excitement. In the evening martial music and
huzzas came floating up to my window from a meeting at the Charleston
Hotel, where the young Virginian Hotspur, Roger A. Pryor, was one of
the prominent speakers. Publicly and privately, the Charlestonians
were boasting over their late Cadmean victory. They had not heard
from the North.</p>

<p>I hoped to remain several days, but the public frenzy had grown so
uncontrollable, that every stranger was subjected to espionage. One
could hardly pick up a newspaper without seeing, or stand ten minutes
in a public place without hearing, of the arrest of some northerner,
charged with being a spy. While the lines of retreat were yet open,
it was judicious to flee from the wrath to come.</p>

<p>Designing to stop for a while in North Carolina, whose Rip Van
Winkle sleep seemed proof against any possible convulsion, I took
the midnight train northward. A number of Baltimoreans on board were
returning home, after assisting at the capture of Sumter. They were
voluble and boisterous Rebels, declaring in good set terms that
Maryland would shortly be revolutionized, Governor Hicks and Henry
Winter Davis hanged, and President Lincoln driven out of Washington.
They averred with great vehemence and iteration that the Yankees were
all cowards, and could easily be "whipped out;" but when one, whose
denunciations had been peculiarly bitter, was asked: </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Country on Fire.</div>

<p>"Are you going home through Washington?"</p>

<p>"Not I," was the reply<ins>.</ins> "Old Abe might have us
nabbed!<del>'</del><ins>"</ins></p>

<p>We were soon on the clayey soil of the Old North State, which, to the
eye, closely resembles those regions of Ohio near Lake Erie. Hour
after hour, we rode through the deep forests of tall pines, from
which the bark had been stripped for making rosin and turpentine.</p>

<p>My anticipations of quiet proved altogether delusive. President
Lincoln's Proclamation, calling for seventy-five thousand soldiers,
had just arrived by telegraph, and the country was on fire. It was
the first flush of excitement here, and the feeling was more intense
and demonstrative than in those States which had become accustomed
to the Revolution. Forts were being seized, negroes and white men
impressed to labor upon them, military companies forming, clergymen
taking up the musket, and women encouraging the determination to
fight the "Abolitionists." All Union sentiment was awed into utter
silence.</p>

<p>While the train was stopping at Wilmington, a telegram, announcing
that Virginia had passed a Secession ordinance, was received with
yells of applause. Sitting alone at one end of the car, I observed
three fellow-passengers, with whom I had formed a traveling
acquaintance, conferring earnestly. Their frequent glances toward
me indicated the subject of the conversation. As I had said nothing
to define my political position, I resolved to set myself right at
once, should they put me to the test. One of them approached me, and
remarked:</p>

<p>"We just have news that Virginia has seceded."</p>

<p>I replied, with considerable emphasis: "Good! That will give us all
the border States."</p>

<p>Apparently satisfied, he returned to his friends, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
they said no more to me upon the all-absorbing question.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Submitting to Rebel Scrutiny.</div>

<p>A fragment of conversation which occurred near me, will illustrate
the general tone of remark. A young man observed to a gentleman
beside him:</p>

<p>"We shall have possession of Washington before the first of June."</p>

<p>"Do you think so? Lincoln is going to call out an army of one hundred
and fifty thousand men."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, we can whip them out any morning before breakfast. Throw
three or four shells among those blue-bellied Yankees and they will
scatter like a flock of sheep!"</p>

<p>Up to this day I had earnestly hoped that a bloody conflict
between the two sections might be averted; but these remarks were
so frequent&mdash;the opinion that northerners were unmitigated
cowards seemed so universal,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"
href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> that I began to look with
a great deal of complacency upon the prospect which the South enjoyed
of testing this faith. It was time to ascertain, once for all,
whether these gentlemen of the cotton and the canebrake were indeed
a superior race, destined to wield the scepter, or whether their
pretensions were mere arrogance and swagger.</p>

<p>It seemed impossible for the southern mind to comprehend that he
who never blusters, or flourishes the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
bowie-knife, who will endure a great deal before fighting, who would
rather suffer a wrong than do a wrong, is, when roused, the most
dangerous of adversaries&mdash;a fact so universal, that it has given
us the proverb, "Beware the fury of a patient man."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The North Heard From.</div>

<p>New York papers, issued after receiving intelligence of the
fall of Sumter, now reached us, and both in their news and
editorial columns indicated how suddenly that event had aroused
the whole North. The voice of every journal was for war. <cite>The
Herald</cite>, which one morning spoke bitterly against coercion,
received a visit during the day from several thousand tumultuous
citizens, who left it the alternative of running up the American flag
or having its office torn down. By the presence of the police, and
the intercession of leading Union men, its property was saved from
destruction. In next morning's paper appeared one of its periodical
and constitutional somersaults. Its four editorial articles all cried
"War to the knife!"</p>

<p>The Rebels were greatly surprised, half appalled, and doubly
exasperated at the unexpected change of all the northern papers which
they had counted friendly to them; but they also shouted "War!" even
louder than before.</p>

<p>At Goldsboro, where we stopped for supper, a small slab of marble,
standing upon the mantel in the hotel office, had these words upon it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"Sacred to the memory of A. Lincoln, who died of a broken
   neck, at Newburn, April 16, 1861."</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">An Inebriated Patriot.</div>

<p>Before the train started again, a young patriot, whose articulation
was impeded by whisky, passed through it, asking:</p>

<p>"S'thr any --- ---- Yankee onth'strain? F'thr's a --- ---- Union
man board these cars, Ic'nwhip him by ---. H'rahfr Jeff. Davis
nth'southrncnfdrcy!" He afterward

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
amused himself by firing his revolver from the car door. At the next
station he stepped out upon the platform, and repeated:</p>

<p>"H'rah fr Jeff. Davis n'th'Southrn Confdrcy!" Another patriot among
the bystanders at the station promptly responded:</p>

<p>"Good. Hurra for Jeff. Davis!"</p>

<p>"Yre th'man fr me," responded our passenger; "Come 'n' takeadrink.
All fr Jeff. Davis here, ain't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Thatsallrightth'n. But what d'you elect that ---- ---- Abolitionist,
Murphy, t'th' Leg'slature for?"</p>

<p>"<em>I'm</em> Murphy," replied the patriot, who had been standing in the
group, but now sprang forward belligerently. "Who calls <em>me</em> an
Abolitionist?"</p>

<p>"Beg y'r padon sr. Reck'n you ain't the man. But who <em>is</em> that
Abolitionist you 'lected here? 's name's Brown, 'sn't it? Yes, that's
it. ---- ---- Brown; y'ought t'hang <em>him</em>!"</p>

<p>Just then the whistle shrieked and the train moved on, amid shouts of
laughter.</p>

<p>At six o'clock next morning, we reached Richmond. Here, also, I had
hoped to stop, but the caldron was seething too hotly. Rebel flags
were everywhere flying, the newspapers all exulted over the passage
of the Secession ordinance, and some of them warned northerners and
Union men to leave the country forthwith. The tone of conversation,
too, was very bitter. The farther I went, the intenser the frenzy;
and, beginning to wonder whether there was any safe haven south of
Philadelphia or New York, I continued northward without a moment's
unnecessary delay.</p>

<p>The railway accommodations grew better in exact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
ratio to our approach to Mason and Dixon's line, and northern
physiognomies were numerous on the train. At Ashland, a few miles
north of Richmond, the first palatable meal since leaving the Alabama
River was set before us. All the intervening distance, to the
epicurean eye, stretched out in a dreary perspective of bacon and
corn bread.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Old Dominion in a Frenzy.</div>

<p>Half the passengers were soldiers. Every village bristled with
bayonets. At Fredericksburgh, one of the polished F. F. V.'s on
the platform presented his face at our window, and asked what the
unmentionable-to-ears-polite all these people were going north for?
As the passengers maintained an "heroic reticence," he exploded a
fresh oath, and went to the next car to pursue his investigations.</p>

<p>A citizen of Richmond, who occupied the seat with me, satisfied
that I was sound on the Secession question, assured me that it had
been very difficult to get the ordinance through the Convention;
that trouble was anticipated from Union men in Western Virginia;
that business in Richmond was utterly suspended, New York exchange
commanding a premium of fifteen per cent.</p>

<p>"We are fearful," he added, "of difficulty with our free negroes.
There are several thousand in Richmond, many of whom are intelligent,
and some wealthy. They show signs of turbulence, and we are
perfecting an organization to hold them in check. I sent the money
to New York this morning for a quantity of Sharp's rifles, ordering
them to be forwarded in dry-goods boxes, that they might not excite
suspicion."</p>

<p>He added, that Ben McCulloch was in Virginia, and had perfected a
plan by which, at the head of Rebel troops, he was about to capture
Washington. As we

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
progressed northward, the noisy Secession element grew small by
degrees, and beautifully less. At Acquia Creek, we left the cars and
took a steamer up the Potomac.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Old Flag Once More.</div>

<p>A quiet gentleman, who had come on board at Richmond, impressed
me, through that mysterious freemasonry which exists among
journalists&mdash;indeed, between members of all professions&mdash;as
a representative of the Fourth Estate. In reply to inquiries, he
informed me that he had been reporting the Virginia Convention for
<cite>The Richmond Enquirer</cite>, but, being a New Yorker, had
concluded, like Jerry Blossom, he wanted "to go home." He described
the Convention, which at first had an emphatic majority for the
Government; but in time, one Union man after another was dragooned
into the ranks, until a bare Secession majority was obtained.</p>

<p>The ordinance explicitly provided that it should not take effect
until submitted to the popular vote; but the State authorities
immediately assumed that it would be ratified. Senator Mason wrote
a public letter, warning all Union men to leave the State; and
before the time for voting arrived, the Secessionists succeeded in
inaugurating a bloody conflict upon the soil, and bringing in armies
from the Gulf States. It was then ratified by a large majority.</p>

<p>We steamed up the Potomac, passed the quiet tomb at Mount Vernon,
which was soon to hear the clangor of contending armies, and early
in the afternoon came in sight of Washington. There, at last, thank
God! was the old Starry Banner, flying in triumph over the Capitol,
the White House, the departments, and hundreds of dwellings. Albeit
unused to the melting mood, my heart was full, and my eyelids
quivered as I saw it. Until that hour, I never knew how I loved the
old flag!</p>

<p>Walking down Pennsylvania avenue, I encountered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
troops of old friends, and constantly wondered that I had been able
to spend ten weeks in the South, without meeting more than two or
three familiar acquaintances.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An Hour with President Lincoln.</div>

<p>A body-guard for the President, made up entirely of citizens of
Kansas, armed with Sharp's rifles, was on duty every night at the
White House. It contained two United States Senators, three members
and ex-members of Congress, the Chief-Justice of the Supreme Court,
and several editors and other prominent citizens of that patriotic
young State.</p>

<p>With two friends, I spent an hour at the White House. The President,
though overwhelmed with business, received us kindly, and economized
time by taking a cup of tea while conversing with us, and inquiring
very minutely about affairs in the seceding States.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown,"</p></div>

<p>though the crown be only the chaplet of a Republic.</p>

<p>This man had filled the measure of American ambition, but the
remembered brightness of his face was in strange contrast with the
weary, haggard look it now wore, and his blushing honors seemed
pallid and ashen. There was the same honest, kindly tone&mdash;the same
fund of humorous anecdote&mdash;the same genuineness; but the old, free,
lingering laugh was gone.</p>

<p>"Mr. Douglas," remarked the President, "spent three hours with
me this afternoon. For several days he has been too unwell for
business, and has devoted his time to studying war-matters, until he
understands the military position better, perhaps, than any one of
the Cabinet. By the way," continued Mr. Lincoln, with his peculiar
twinkle of the eye, "the conversation turned upon the rendition of
slaves. 'You know,' said Douglas, 'that I am entirely sound on the
Fugitive Slave

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
 Law. I am for enforcing it in all cases within its
true intent and meaning; but, after examining it carefully, I have
concluded that a negro insurrection is a case to which it does not
apply.'"</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <span class="smcap">Panic in Wash&shy;ing&shy;ton.</span>
</div>

<p>I had not come north a moment too early. The train which brought
me from Richmond to Acquia Creek was the last which the Rebel
authorities permitted to pass without interruption, and the steamer,
on reaching Washington, was seized by our own Government, and made
no more regular trips. Before I had been an hour in the Capital,
the telegraph wires were cut, and railway tracks in Maryland torn
up. Intelligence of the murderous attack of a Baltimore mob on the
Sixth Massachusetts regiment, <span lang="la">en route</span> for
Washington, startled the town from its propriety.</p>

<p>Chaos had come again. Washington was the seat of an intense panic. An
attack from the Rebels was hourly expected, and hundreds of families
fled from the city in terror. During the next two days, twenty-five
hundred well-officered, resolute men could undoubtedly have captured
the city. The air was filled with extravagant and startling rumors.
From Virginia, Union refugees were hourly arriving, often after
narrow escapes from the frenzied populace.</p>

<p>Massachusetts soldiers, who had safely run the Baltimore gantlet of
death, were quartered in the United States Senate Chamber. They had
mustered with characteristic promptness. At 5 o'clock one evening,
a telegram reached Boston asking for troops for the defense of the
imperiled Capital. At 9 o'clock the next morning, the first company,
having come twenty-five miles from the country, stacked arms in
Faneuil Hall. At 5 o'clock that night the Sixth Regiment, with full
ranks, started for Washington. They were fine-looking

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
fellows, but greatly embittered by their Baltimore experience. In a
very quiet, undemonstrative way, they manifested an earnest desire
for immediate and active service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"<span class="smcap">Came Out to Fight!</span>"</div>

<p>The bewilderment and terror which had so long rested like a nightmare
on the National authorities&mdash;which for months had left almost every
leading Republican statesman timid and undecided&mdash;was at last over.
The echoes of the Charleston guns broke the spell! The masses had
been heard from! Then, as at later periods of the war, the popular
instinct was clearer and truer than all the wisdom of the politicians.</p>

<p>During the three days I spent in Washington, the city was virtually
blockaded, receiving neither mails, telegrams, nor re-enforcements.
Martial law, though not declared, was sadly needed. Most of the
Secessionists had left, but enough remained to serve as spies for the
Virginia Revolutionists.</p>

<p>I left for New York, by an evening train crowded with fleeing
families. Most of them went west from the Relay House, deterred from
passing through Baltimore by the reign of terror which the Rebels
had inaugurated. The most zealous Union papers advocated Secession
as their only means of personal and pecuniary safety. The State and
city authorities, though professedly loyal, bowed helpless before
the storm. Governor Sprague, with his Rhode Island volunteers, had
started for Washington. Mayor Brown telegraphed him, requesting that
they should not come through Baltimore, as it would exasperate the
people.</p>

<p>"The Rhode Island regiment," was Sprague's epigrammatic response,
"came out to fight, and may just as well fight in Maryland as in
Virginia." It passed unmolested! </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Baltimore under Rebel Rule.</div>

<p>We found Baltimore in a frenzy. The whole city seemed under arms. The
Union men were utterly silenced, and many had fled. The only person
I heard express undisguised loyalty was a young lady from Boston,
and only her sex protected her. Several persons had been arrested as
spies during the day, including two supposed correspondents of New
York papers.</p>

<p>Baltimore, for the time, was worse than any thing I had seen in
Charleston, New Orleans, or Mobile. Through the evening Barnum's
hotel was filled with soldiers. Stepping into the office to make
arrangements for going to Philadelphia, I encountered an old
acquaintance from Cincinnati, now commanding a Baltimore company
under arms:</p>

<p>"If Lincoln persists in attempting to send troops through Maryland,"
said he, "we are bound to have his head!"</p>

<p>Another Baltimorean came up and began to question me, but my
acquaintance promptly vouched for me as "a true southern man," and I
escaped annoyance. The same belief was expressed here which prevailed
throughout the whole South, that northern men were cowards; and
persons actually alluded to the attack upon the unarmed Massachusetts
troops as an act of bravery.</p>

<p>Leaving Baltimore, I took a carriage for the nearest northern railway
point. The roads were crowded with families leaving the city, and
infested by Rebel scouts and patrols. Union citizens were helpless.
One of them said to us:</p>

<p>"For God's sake, beg the Administration and the North not to let us
be crushed out!"</p>

<p>We hoped to take the Philadelphia cars, twenty-six miles out, but a
detachment of Baltimore soldiers that very morning had passed up the
railroad, destroying

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
every bridge; smoke was still rising from their ruins. We were
compelled to press on and on, until, in the evening, after a ride of
forty-six miles, we reached York, Pennsylvania.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The North Fully Aroused.</div>

<p>Here, at last, we could breathe freely. But both railroads being
monopolized by troops, we were compelled, wearily, to drive on to the
village of Columbia, on the Susquehanna river. There we began to see
that the North, as well as the South, was under martial rule. Armed
sentinels peremptorily ordered us to halt.</p>

<p>On identifying the driver, and learning my business, they allowed us
to proceed. At the bridge, the person in charge declined to open the
gate:</p>

<p>"I guess you can't cross to-night, sir," said he.</p>

<p>I replied by "guessing" that we could; but he continued:</p>

<p>"Our orders are positive, to let no one pass who is not personally
known to us."</p>

<p>He soon became convinced that I was not an emissary of the enemy; and
the sentinels escorted us across the bridge, a mile and a quarter in
length. We proceeded undisturbed to Lancaster, arriving there at two
o'clock, after a carriage-ride of seventy miles. Thence to New York,
communication was undisturbed.</p>

<p>The cold-blooded North was fully aroused. Rebel sympathizers found
themselves utterly swept away by a Niagara of public indignation. In
Pennsylvania, in New York, in New England, I heard only the sentiment
that talking must be ended, and acting begun; that, cost what it
might, in money and blood, all must unite to crush the gigantic
Treason which was closing its fangs upon the throat of the Republic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Uprising of the Whole People.</div>

<p>The people seemed much more radical than the President. In all public
places, threats were heard that, if

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
the Administration faltered, it must be overturned, and a
dictatorship established. Against the Monumental City, feeling was
peculiarly bitter. All said:</p>

<p>"If National troops can not march unmolested through Baltimore, that
city has stood long enough! Not one stone shall be left upon another."</p>

<p>I had witnessed a good deal of earnestness and enthusiasm in the
South, but nothing at all approaching this wonderful uprising of the
whole people. All seemed imbued with the sentiment of those official
papers issued before Napoleon was First Consul, beginning, "In the
name of the French Republic, <em>one and indivisible</em>."</p>

<p>It was worth a lifetime to see it&mdash;to find down through
all the <span lang="fr">d&eacute;bris</span> of money-seeking, and
all the strata of politics, this underlying, primary formation of
loyalty&mdash;this unfaltering determination to vindicate the right
of the majority, the only basis of republican government.</p>

<p>The storm-cloud had burst; the Irrepressible Conflict was upon us.
Where would it end? What forecast or augury could tell? Revolutions
ride rough-shod over all probabilities; and who has mastered the
logic of civil war?</p>

<p>Here ended a personal experience, sometimes full of discomfort, but
always full of interest. It enabled me afterward to look at Secession
from the stand-point of those who inaugurated it; to comprehend Rebel
acts and utterances, which had otherwise been to me a sealed book. It
convinced me, too, of the thorough earnestness of the Revolutionists.
My published prediction, that we should have a seven years' war
unless the country used its utmost vigor and resources, seemed to
excite a mild suspicion of lunacy among my personal acquaintances.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <span class="smcap">A Tribune Cor&shy;res&shy;pon&shy;dent on Trial.</span>
</div>

<p>I was the last member of <cite>The Tribune</cite> staff to leave the South.
By rare good fortune, all its correspondents

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
escaped personal harm, while representatives of several other New
York journals were waited upon by vigilance committees, driven out,
and in some cases imprisoned. It was a favorite jest, that <cite>The
Tribune</cite> was the only northern paper whose <em>attach&eacute;s</em> were
allowed in the South.</p>

<p>Its South Carolinian correspondence had a peculiar history.
Immediately after the Presidential election, Mr. Charles D. Brigham
went to Charleston as its representative. With the exception of two
or three weeks, he remained there from November until February,
writing almost daily letters. The Charlestonians were excited and
indignant, and arrested in all five or six persons whom they unjustly
suspected.</p>

<p>Finally, about the middle of February, Mr. Brigham was one day
taken into custody, and brought before Governor Pickens and his
cabinet counselors, among whom Ex-Governor McGrath was the principal
inquisitor. At this time the Southern Confederacy existed only in
embryo, and South Carolina claimed to be an independent republic.
The correspondent, who had great coolness and self-control, and knew
a good deal of human nature, maintained a serene exterior despite
the awkwardness of his position. After a rigid catechisation, he
was relieved to find that the tribunal did not surmise his real
character, but suspected him of being a spy of the Government.</p>

<p>His trial took place at the executive head-quarters, opposite the
Charleston Hotel, and lasted from nine o'clock in the morning until
nine at night. During the afternoon, the city being disturbed by one
of its daily reports that a Federal fleet had appeared off the bar,
he was turned over to Mr. Alexander H. Brown, a leading criminal
lawyer, famous for his skill in examining witnesses. Mr. Brown
questioned, re-questioned, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
cross-questioned the vagrant scribe, but was completely baffled by
him. He finally said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Brigham, while I think you are all right, this is a peculiar
emergency, and you must see that, under the circumstances, it will be
necessary for you to leave the South at once."</p>

<div class="sidenote">He is Warned to Depart.</div>

<p>The "sweet sorrow" of parting gladdened his journalistic heart; but,
at the bidding of prudence, he replied:</p>

<p>"I hope not, sir. It is very hard for one who, as you are bound to
admit, after the most rigid scrutiny, has done nothing improper, who
has deported himself as a gentleman should, who sympathizes with you
as far as a stranger can, to be driven out in this way."</p>

<p>The attorney replied, with that quiet significance which such remarks
possessed:</p>

<p>"I am sorry, sir, that it is not a question for argument."</p>

<p>The lucky journalist, while whispering he would ne'er consent,
consented. Whereupon the lawyer, who seemed to have some qualms of
conscience, invited him to join in a bottle of wine, and when they
had become a little convivial, suddenly asked:</p>

<p>"By the way, do you know who is writing the letters from here to <cite>The
Tribune</cite>?<ins>"</ins></p>

<p>"Why, no," was the answer. "I haven't seen a copy of that paper for
six months; but I supposed there was no such person, as I had read in
your journals that the letters were purely fictitious."</p>

<p>"There <em>is</em> such a man," replied Brown; "and thus far, though we have
arrested four or five persons, supposing that we had found him, he
completely baffles us. Now, when you get home to New York, can't you
ascertain who he is, and let us know?" </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <span class="smcap">Tribune Rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;tatives in Charleston.</span>
</div>

<p>Mr. Brigham, knowing exactly what tone to adopt with the "Chivalry,"
replied:</p>

<p>"Of course, sir, I would not act as a spy for you or anybody
else. However, such things have a kind of publicity; are talked of
in saloons and on street-corners. If I can learn in that way who
<cite>The Tribune</cite> correspondent is, I shall deem it my duty to
advise you."</p>

<p>The lawyer listened with credulity to this whisper of hope, though
a well-known Rebel detective, named Shoubac&mdash;a swarthy, greasy,
uncomfortable fellow, with a Jewish countenance&mdash;did not. He remarked
to the late prisoner:</p>

<p>"You haven't fooled <em>me</em>, if you have Brown."</p>

<p>But Mr. Brigham was allowed to depart in peace for New York.
<cite>The Tribune</cite> afterward had in Charleston five or six different
correspondents, usually keeping two there at a time for emergencies.
Often they did not know each other personally; and there was no
communication between them. When one was arrested, there was always
another in reserve to continue the correspondence. Mr. Brigham,
who remained in the home editorial rooms, retouched the letters
just enough to stamp them as the work of one hand, and the baffled
authorities went hopelessly up and down to cast out the evil spirit
which troubled their peace, and whose unsuspected name was legion.</p>

<p>Sancho Panza passed away too early. To-day, he would extend his

<div class="sidenote">A Sunday at Niagara Falls.</div>

<p>Thus I soliloquized one May evening, when, in pursuit of that "seat
of war," as yet visible only to the prophetic eye, or in newspaper
columns, I turned my face westward. It were more exact to say,
"turned my heels." Inexorable conductors compel the drowsy passenger
to ride feet foremost, on the hypothesis that he would rather break a
leg than knock his brains out.</p>

<p>I was detained for a day at Suspension Bridge; but life has more
afflictive dispensations, even for the impatient traveler, than a
Sunday at Niagara Falls. Vanity of vanities indeed must existence
be to him who could not find a real Sabbath at the great cataract,
laying his tired head upon the calm breast of Nature, and feeling the
pulsations of her deep, loving heart!</p>

<p>Eight years had intervened since my last visit. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
was no second pang of the disappointment we feel in seeing for the
first time any object of world-wide fame. In Nature, as in Art, the
really great, however falling below the ideal at first glance, grows
upon the beholder forever afterward.</p>

<p>Though the visiting season had not begun, the harpies were waiting
for their victims. Step out of your hotel, or turn a corner, and one
instantly pounced upon you. But, though numerous, they were quiet,
and decorous manners, even in leeches, are above all praise.</p>

<p>Everybody at the Falls is eager to shield you from the extortion of
everybody else. The driver, whom you pay two dollars per hour; the
vender, who sells you Indian bead-work at a profit of one hundred per
cent.; the guide, who fleeces you for leading to places you would
rather find without him&mdash;each warns you against the other, with
touching zeal for your welfare. And the precocious boy, who offers a
bit of slate from under the Cataract for two shillings, cautions you
to beware of them all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <span class="smcap">View from the Su&shy;spen&shy;sion Bridge.</span>
</div>

<p>As you cross the suspension bridge, the driver points out the spot,
more than two hundred feet above the water, where Blondin, of
tight-rope renown, crossed upon a single strand, with a man upon his
shoulders, cooked his aerial omelet, hung by the heels, and played
other fantastic tricks before high heaven.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Palace of the Frost King.</div>

<p>From the bridge you view three sections of the Cataract. First, is
the lower end of the American Fall, whose deep green is intermingled
with jets and streaks of white. Its smooth surface conveys the
impression of the segment of a slowly revolving wheel rather than of
tumbling water. Beyond the dense foliage appears another section,
parted in the middle by the stone tower on Goat Island. Its water is
of snowy whiteness, and looks

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
like an immense frozen fountain. Still farther is the great
Horse-shoe Fall, its deep green surface veiled at the base in clouds
of pure white mist.</p>

<p>Here, at the distance of two miles, the Falls soothe you with their
quiet, surpassing beauty. But when you reach them on the Canada side,
and go down, down, beneath Table Rock, under the sheet of water, you
feel their sublimity. As you look out upon the sea of snowy foam
below, or through the rainbow hues of the vast sweeping curtain
above, the earth trembles with the unceasing thunder of the cataract.</p>

<p>In winter the effect is grandest. Then, from the bank in front of the
Clifton House, you look down on upright rocks, crowned with pinnacles
of ice, till they rise half way to the summit, or catch glimpses
of the boundless column of water as it strikes the torrent below,
faintly seen through the misty, alabaster spray rising forever from
its troubled bed. Hundreds of white-winged sea-gulls graze the rapids
above, and circle down to plunge in the waters below.</p>

<p>Attired in stiff, cold, water-proof clothing, which, culminating in a
round oil-cloth cap, makes you look like an Esquimaux and feel like a
mummy, you follow the guide far down dark, icy stairs and paths.</p>

<p>Look up ninety feet, and see the great torrent pour over the brink.
Look down seventy feet from your icy little shelf, and behold
it plunge into the dense mist of the boiling gulf. Through its
half-transparent sheet, filtered rays of the bright sunshine struggle
toward your eyes. You are in the palace of the Frost King. Ice&mdash;ice
everywhere, from your slippery foothold to the huge icicles, fifty
feet long and three feet thick, which overhang you like the sword of
Damocles.</p>

<p>Admiration without comparison is vague and unsatisfactory.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Less glorious, because less vast, than the matchless panorama seen
from the summit of Pike's Peak, this picture is nearly as impressive,
because spread right beside you, and at your very feet. Less minutely
beautiful than the exquisite chambers of the Mammoth Cave, its great
range and sweep make it more grand and imposing.</p>

<p>Along the Great Western Railway of Canada, the country closely
resembles northern Ohio; but the people have uncompromising English
faces. A well-dressed farmer and his wife rode upon our train all day
in a second-class car, without seeming in the least ashamed of it&mdash;a
moral courage not often exhibited in the United States.</p>

<p>At Detroit, an invalid, pale, wasted, unable to speak above a
whisper, was lying on a bed hastily spread upon the floor of the
railway station. Her husband, with their two little boys bending over
her in tears, told us that they had been driven from New Orleans, and
he was now taking his dying wife to their old home in Maine. There
were few dry eyes among the lookers-on. A liberal sum of money was
raised on the spot for the destitute family, whose broken pride,
after some persuasion, accepted it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chicago Rising from the Earth.</div>

<p>The next morning we reached Chicago. In that breezy city upon the
lake shore, property was literally rising. Many of the largest brick
and stone blocks were being elevated five or six feet, by a very nice
system of screws under their walls, while people were constantly
pouring in and out of them, and the transaction of business was
not impeded. The stupendous enterprise was undertaken that the
streets might be properly graded and drained. This summoning a great
metropolis to rise from its vasty deep of mud, is one of the modern
miracles

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
of mechanics, which make even geological revelations appear trivial
and common-place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mysteries of Western Currency.</div>

<p>The world has many mysteries, but none more inscrutable than Western
Currency. The notes of most Illinois and Wisconsin banks, based on
southern State bonds, having depreciated steadily for several weeks,
gold and New York exchange now commanded a premium of twenty per
cent. The Michigan Central Railway Company was a good illustration
of the effect of this upon Chicago interests. That corporation
was paying six thousand dollars per week in premiums upon eastern
exchange. Yet the hotels and mercantile houses were receiving the
currency at par. One Illinois bank-note depreciated just seventy per
cent., during the twelve hours it spent in my possession!</p>

<p>In Chicago I encountered an old friend just from Memphis. His
association with leading Secessionists for some time protected him;
but the popular frenzy was now so wild that they counselled him, as
he valued his life, to stay not upon the order of his going, but go
at once.</p>

<p>The Memphians were repudiating northern debts, and, with unexampled
ferocity, driving out all men suspected of Abolitionism or Unionism.
More than five thousand citizens had been forced or frightened away,
and in many cases beggared. A secret Committee of Safety, made up of
prominent citizens, was ruling with despotic sway.</p>

<p>Scores of suspected persons were brought before it daily, and, if
they could not exculpate themselves, sentenced to banishment, with
head half shaved, to whipping, or to death. Though, by the laws of
all slave States, negroes were precluded from testifying against
white men, this inquisition received their evidence. My friend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
dared not avow that he was coming North, but purchased a ticket for
St. Louis, which was then deemed a Rebel stronghold.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <span class="smcap">A Horrible Spectacle in Arkansas.</span>
</div>

<p>As the steamer passed Osceola, Arkansas, he saw the body of a man
hanging by the heels, in full view of the river. A citizen told him
that it had been there for eight days; that the wretched victim,
upon mere suspicion of tampering with slaves, was suspended, head
downward, and suffered intensely before death came to his relief.</p>

<p>All on board the crowded steamboat pretended to be Secessionists. But
when, at last, nearing Cairo, they saw the Stars and Stripes, first
one, then another, began to huzza. The enthusiasm was contagious; and
in a moment nearly all, many with heaving breasts and streaming eyes,
gave vent to their long-suppressed feeling in one tumultuous cheer
for the Flag of the Free. Of the one hundred and fifty passengers,
nearly every man was a fleeing Unionist.</p>

<p>The all-pervading railroad and telegraph in the North began to show
their utility in war. Cairo, the extreme southern point of Illinois,
now garrisoned by Union troops, was threatened by the enemy. The
superintendent of the Illinois Central Railway (including branches,
seven hundred and four miles in length) assured me that, at ten
hours' notice, he could start, from the various points along his
line, <em>four miles</em> of cars, capable of transporting twenty-four
thousand soldiers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <span class="smcap">Pat&shy;rio&shy;tism of the Northwest.</span>
</div>

<p>The Rebels now began to perceive their mistake in counting upon
the friendship of the great Northwest. Indeed, of all their wild
dreams, this was wildest. They expected the very States which claimed
Mr. Lincoln as from their own section, and voted for him by heavy
majorities, to help break up the Union because he was elected! Though
learning their delusion, they never

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
comprehended its cause. After the war had continued nearly a year,
<cite>The New Orleans Delta</cite> said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"The people of the Northwest are our natural allies, and
   ought to be fighting on our side. It is the profoundest
   mystery of these times how the few Yankee peddlers and
   school-marms there have been able to convert them into our
   bitter enemies."</p>
</div>

<p>On the mere instinct of nationality&mdash;the bare question of an
undivided republic&mdash;the West would perhaps fight longer, and
sacrifice more, than any other section. Its people, if not more
earnest, are much more demonstrative than their eastern brethren.
Their long migration from the Atlantic States to the Mississippi, the
Missouri, or the Platte, has quickened and enlarged their patriotism.
It has made our territorial greatness to them no abstraction, but a
reality.</p>

<p>No one else looks forward with such faith and fervor to that great
future when man shall "fill up magnificently the magnificent designs
of Nature;" when their Mississippi Valley shall be the heart of
mightiest empire; when, from all these mingling nationalities, shall
spring the ripe fruitage of free schools and free ballots, in a
higher average Man than the World has yet seen.</p>

<p>Our train from Chicago to St. Louis was crowded with Union troops.
Along the route booming guns saluted them; handkerchiefs fluttered
from windows; flags streamed from farm-houses and in village streets;
old men and boys at the plow huzzaed themselves hoarse.</p>

<p>Thus, at the rising of the curtain, the northwestern States, worthy
offspring of the Ordinance of Eighty-seven, were sending out&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"A multitude, like which the populous North Poured never

<p>Four blood-stained years have not dimmed their faith

they furnished many guests." What histories have they not made
for themselves! Ohio, Iowa, Kansas, Wisconsin&mdash;indeed, if
we call their roll, which State has not covered herself with

<div class="sidenote">
   <span class="smcap">Missouri Rebels bent on Rev&shy;olu&shy;tion.</span>
</div>

<p>In St. Louis I found at last a "seat of war." Recent days had been
full of startling events. The Missouri Legislature, at Jefferson
City, desired to pass a Secession ordinance, but had no pretext for
doing so. The election of a State Convention, to consider this very
subject, had just demonstrated, by overwhelming Union majorities, the
loyalty of the masses. Claiborne Fox Jackson, the Governor, was a
Secessionist, and was determined to plunge Missouri into revolution.
This flagrant, open warfare against the popular majority, well
illustrated how grossly the Rebels deceived themselves in supposing
that their conduct was impelled by regard for State Rights, rather
than by the inherent antagonism between free and slave labor.</p>

<p>Camp Jackson, commanded by Gen. D. M. Frost, was established at
Lindell Grove, two miles west of St. Louis, "for the organization
and instruction of the State Militia." It embraced some Union men,
both officers and privates. Frost and his friends claimed that it was
loyal; but the State flag, only, was flying from the camp, and its
streets were named "Davis Avenue," "Beauregard Avenue," etc. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Nathaniel Lyon and Camp Jackson.</div>

<p>An envoy extraordinary, sent by Governor Jackson, had just returned
from Louisiana with shot, shell, and mortars&mdash;all stolen from the
United States Arsenal at Baton Rouge. The camp was really designed as
the nucleus of a Secession force, to seize the Government property
in St. Louis and drive out the Federal authorities. But the Union
men were too prompt for the Rebels. Long before the capture of Fort
Sumter, nightly drills were instituted among the loyal Germans of
St. Louis; and within two weeks after the President's first call for
troops, Missouri had ten thousand Union soldiers, armed, equipped,
and in camp.</p>

<p>The first act of the Union authorities was to remove by night all
the munitions from the United States Arsenal near St. Louis, to
Alton, Illinois. When the Rebels learned it, they were intensely
exasperated. The Union troops were commanded by a quiet, slender,
stooping, red-haired, pale-faced officer, who walked about in brown
linen coat, wearing no military insignia. He was by rank a captain;
his name was Nathaniel Lyon.</p>

<p>On the tenth of May, Capt. Lyon, with three or four hundred regulars,
and enough volunteers to swell his forces to five thousand, planted
cannon upon the hills commanding Camp Jackson, and sent to Gen. Frost
a note, reciting conclusive evidence of its treasonable intent, and
concluding as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"I do hereby demand of you an immediate surrender of your
   command, with no other conditions than that all persons surrendering
   shall be humanely and kindly treated. Believing myself prepared to
   enforce this demand, one-half hour's time will be allowed for your
   compliance."</p>
</div>

<p>This contrasted so sharply with the shuffling timidity of our civil
and military authorities, usual at this period,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
that Frost was surprised and "shocked." His reply, of course,
characterized the demand as "illegal" and "unconstitutional." In
those days there were no such sticklers for the Constitution as the
men taking up arms against it! Frost wrote that he surrendered only
upon compulsion&mdash;his forces being too weak for resistance. The
encampment was found to contain twenty cannon, more than twelve
hundred muskets, many mortars, siege-howitzers, and shells, charged
ready for use&mdash;which convinced even the most skeptical that it
was something more than a school for instruction.</p>

<p>The garrison, eight hundred strong, were marched out under guard.
There were many thousands of spectators. Hills, fields, and
house-tops were black with people. In spite of orders to disperse,
crowds followed, jeering the Union troops, throwing stones,
brickbats, and other missiles, and finally discharging pistols.
Several soldiers were hurt, and one captain shot down at the head
of his company, when the troops fired on the crowd, killing twenty
and wounding eleven. As in all such cases, several innocent persons
suffered.</p>

<p>Intense excitement followed. A large public meeting convened
that evening in front of the Planter's House&mdash;heard bitter
speeches from Governor Jackson, Sterling Price, and others. The
crowd afterward went to mob <cite>The Democrat</cite> office, but
it contained too many resolute Unionists, armed with rifles and
hand-grenades, and they wisely desisted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sterling Price Joins the Rebels.</div>

<p>Sterling Price was president of the State Convention&mdash;elected
as an Unconditional Unionist. But, in this whirlwind, he went over to
the enemy. An old feud existed between him and a leading St. Louis
loyalist. Price had a small, detached command in the Mexican war.
Afterward, he was Governor of Missouri, and candidate

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
for the United States Senate. An absurd sketch, magnifying a trivial
skirmish into a great battle, with Price looming up heroically in the
foreground, was drawn and engraved by an unfortunate artist, then
in the Penitentiary. It pleased Price's vanity; he circulated it
largely, and pardoned out the suffering votary of art.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Severe Loss to the Unionists.</div>

<p>When the Legislature was about voting for United States Senator,
Frank Blair, Jr., then a young member from St. Louis, obtained
permission to say a few words about the candidates. He was a great
vessel of wrath, and administered a terrible excoriation, pronouncing
Price "worthy the genius of a convict artist, and fit subject for a
Penitentiary print!" Price was defeated, and the rupture never healed.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the Rebellion, Price was far more loyal than men
afterward prominent Union leaders in Missouri. In those chaotic
days, very slight influences decided the choice of many. By tender
treatment, Price could doubtless have been retained; but neither
party regarded him as possessing much ability.</p>

<p>His defection proved a calamity to the Loyalists. He was worth twenty
thousand soldiers to the Rebels, and developed rare military talent.
Like Robert E. Lee, he was an old man, of pure personal character,
sincerity, kindness of heart, and unequaled popularity among the
self-sacrificing ragamuffins whom he commanded. He held them
together, and induced them to fight with a bravery and persistency
which, Rebels though they were, was creditable to the American name.
With a good cause, they would have challenged the world's acclamation.</p>

<p>At this time the President was treating the border slave States
with marvelous tenderness and timidity.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
The Rev. M. D. Conway declared, wittily, that Mr. Lincoln's daily and
nightly invocation ran:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"O Lord, I desire to have Thee on my side, but I <em>must</em>
   have Kentucky!"</p>
</div>

<p>Captain Lyon was confident that if he asked permission to seize Camp
Jackson, it would be refused. So he captured the camp, and then
telegraphed to Washington&mdash;not what he proposed to do, but what he
<em>had</em> done. At first his act was disapproved. But the loyal country
applauded to the echo, and Lyon's name was everywhere honored. Hence
the censure was withheld, and he was made a Brigadier-General!</p>

<div class="sidenote">St. Louis in a Convulsion.</div>

<p>Governor Jackson burned the bridges on the Pacific Railroad; the
Missouri Legislature passed an indirect ordinance of Secession,
and adjourned in a panic, caused by reports that Lyon was coming;
a Union regiment was attacked in St. Louis, and again fired into
the mob, with deadly results. The city was convulsed with terror.
Every available vehicle, including heavy ox wagons, was brought
into requisition; every outgoing railway train was crowded with
passengers; every avenue was thronged with fugitives; every steamer
at the levee was laden with families, who, with no definite idea of
where they were going, had hastily packed a few articles of clothing,
to flee from the general and bloody conflict supposed to be impending
between the Americans and the Dutch, as Secessionists artfully termed
the two parties. Thus there became a "Seat of War."</p>

<p>Heart-rending as were the stories of most southern refugees, some
were altogether ludicrous. In St. Louis, I encountered an old
acquaintance who related to me his recent experiences in Nashville.
Grandiloquent enough they sounded; for his private conversation
always ran into stump speeches. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Nashville Experience.</div>

<p>"One day," said he, "I was waited on by a party of leading Nashville
citizens, who remarked: 'Captain May, <em>we</em> know very well that you
are with us in sentiment; but, as you come from the North, others,
less intimate with you, desire some special assurance.' I replied:
'Gentlemen, by education, by instinct, and by association, I am a
Southern man. But, gentlemen, when you fire upon that small bit of
bunting known as the American flag, you can count me, by Heaven, as
your persistent and uncompromising foe!' The committee intimated to
me that the next train for the North started in one hour! You may
stake your existence, sir, that the subscriber came away on that
train. Confound a country, anyhow, where a man must wear a Secession
cockade upon each coat-tail to keep himself from being kicked as an
Abolitionist!"</p>

<p>Inexorable war knows no ties of friendship, of family, or of love.
Its bitterest features were seen on the border, where brother was
arrayed against brother, and husband against wife. At a little
Missouri village, the Rebels raised their flag, but it was promptly
torn down by the loyal wife of one of the leaders. I met a lady who
had two brothers in the Union army, and two among Price's Rebels, who
were likely soon to meet on the battle-field.</p>

<p>In St. Louis, a Rebel damsel, just about to be married, separated
from her Union lover, declaring that no man who favored the
Abolitionists and the "Dutch hirelings" could be her husband. He
retorted that he had no use for a wife who sympathized with treason;
and so the match was broken off.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bitterness of Old Neighbors.</div>

<p>I knew a Union soldier who found at Camp Jackson, among the
prisoners, his own brother, wounded by two Mini&eacute; rifle balls. He
said: "I am sorry my brother

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
was shot; but he should not have joined the traitors!" Of course,
the bitterness between relatives and old neighbors, now foes, was
infinitely greater than between northerners and southerners. The
same was true everywhere. How intensely the Virginia and Tennessee
Rebels hated their fellow-citizens who adhered to the Union cause!
Ohio and Massachusetts Loyalists denounced northern "Copperheads"
with a malignity which they never felt toward South Carolinians and
Mississippians.</p>

<p class="quotdate">

<p>When South Carolina seceded, the slave property of Missouri was worth
forty-five millions of dollars; hence she is under bonds to just that
amount to keep the peace. With thirteen hundred miles of frontier,
she is "a slave peninsula in an ocean of free soil." Free Kansas,
which has many old scores to clear up, guards her on the west. Free
Iowa, embittered by hundreds of Union refugees, watches her on the
north. Free Illinois, the young giantess of the prairie, takes care
of her on the east. This loyal metropolis, with ten Union regiments
already under arms, is for her a sort of front-door police. Missouri,
in the significant phrase of the frontier, is

<span lang="es">corraled</span>.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"
href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>Here, at least, as <cite>The Richmond Whig</cite>, just before
going over to the Rebels, so aptly said: "Secession is Abolitionism
in its worst and most dangerous form."</p>

<p>Rebels glare upon Union men like chained wild beasts. Citizens,
walking by night, remember the late assassinations, and, like
Americans in Mexican towns, cast suspicious glances behind.
Secessionists utter fierce

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
threats; but since their recent severe admonition that Unionists,
too, can use fire-arms, and that it is not discreet to attack United
States soldiers, they do not execute them.</p>

<p>Captain Lyon, who commands, is an exceedingly prompt and efficient
officer, attends strictly to his business, exhibits no hunger for
newspaper fame, and seems to act with an eye single to the honor of
the Government he has served so long and so faithfully.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Good Soldiers for Scaling Walls.</div>

<p>Among our regiments is the Missouri First, Colonel Frank P. Blair.
Three companies are made up of German Turners&mdash;the most accomplished
of gymnasts. They are sinewy, muscular fellows, with deep chests and
well-knit frames. Every man is an athlete. To-day a party, by way
of exercise, suddenly formed a human pyramid, and commenced running
up, like squirrels, over each other's shoulders, to the high veranda
upon the second story of their building. In climbing a wall, they
would not require scaling-ladders. There are also two companies from
the Far West&mdash;old trappers and hunters, who have smelt gunpowder in
Indian warfare.</p>

<p>Colonel Blair's dry, epigrammatic humor bewilders some of his
visitors. I was sitting in his head-quarters when a St. Louis
Secessionist entered. Like nearly all of them, he now pretends to be
a Union man, but is very tender on the subject of State Rights, and
wonderfully solicitous about the Constitution. He remarked:</p>

<p>"I am a Union man, but I believe in State Rights. I believe a State
may dissolve its connection with the Government if it wants to."</p>

<p>"O yes," replied Blair, pulling away at his ugly mustache, "yes, you
can go out if you want to. Certainly you can secede. But, my friend,
you can't take with you one foot of American soil!" </p>

<p>A citizen of Lexington introduced himself, saying:</p>

pro-slavery&mdash;I own niggers."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," replied Blair, with the faintest suggestion of a smile
on his plain, grim face, "you have a right to. We don't like negroes
very much ourselves. If <em>you</em> do, that's a matter of taste. It is one

<p>Cairo, as the key to the lower Mississippi valley, is the most
important strategic point in the West. Immediately after the outbreak
of hostilities, it was occupied by our troops.</p>

<p>As a place of residence it was never inviting. To-day its offenses
smell to heaven as rankly as when Dickens evoked it, from horrible
obscurity, as the "Eden" of Martin Chuzzlewit. The low, marshy,
boot-shaped site is protected from the overflow of the Mississippi
and Ohio by levees. Its jet-black soil generates every species of
insect and reptile known to science or imagination. Its atmosphere is
never sweet or pure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General McClellan at Cairo.</div>

<p>On the 13th of June, Major-General George B. McClellan, commander of
all the forces west of the Alleghanies, reached Cairo on a visit of
inspection. His late victories in Western Virginia had established
his reputation for the time, as an officer of great capacity
and promise, notwithstanding the high heroics of his ambitious
proclamations. This was before Bull Run, and before the New York
journals, by absurdly pronouncing him "the Young Napoleon," raised
public expectation to an embarrassing and unreasonable hight.</p>

<p>In those days, every eye was looking for the Coming Man, every ear
listening for his approaching footsteps,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
which were to make the earth tremble. Men judged, by old standards,
that the Hour must have its Hero. They had not learned that, in a
country like ours, whatever is accomplished must be the work of
the loyal millions, not of any one, or two, or twenty generals and
statesmen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Little Speech-Making.</div>

<p>McClellan was enthusiastically received, and, to the strains of
the "Star Spangled Banner," escorted to head-quarters. There, General
Prentiss, who had so decided a <span lang="fr">penchant</span> for
speech-making, that cynics declared he always kept a particular
stump in front of his office for a rostrum, welcomed him with some
rhetorical remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>* * * * "My command are all anxious to taste those dangers
which war ushers in&mdash;not that they court danger, but that
they love their country. We have toiled in the mud, we have
drilled in the burning sun. Many of us are ragged&mdash;all of
us are poor. But we look anxiously for the order to move,
trusting that we may be allowed to lead the division."</p></div>

<p>The soldiers applauded enthusiastically&mdash;for in those days the
anxiety to be in the earliest battles was intense. The impression
was almost universal throughout the North that the war was to be
very brief. Officers and men in the army feared they would have no
opportunity to participate in any fighting!</p>

<p>McClellan responded to Prentiss and his officers in the same strain:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* "We shall meet again upon the tented field; and
   Illinois, which sent forth a Hardin and a Bissell, will, I doubt not,
   give a good account of herself to her sister States. Her fame is
   world-wide: in your hands, gentlemen, I am sure it will not suffer.
   The advance is due to you."</p>
</div>

<p>Then there was more applause, and afterward a review of the brigade. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Penalty of Writing for the Tribune.</div>

<p>General McClellan is stoutly built, short, with light hair, blue
eyes, full, fresh, almost boyish face, and lip tufted with a brown
mustache. His urbane manner truly indicates the peculiar amiability
of character and yielding disposition which have hurt him more than
all other causes. An officer once assured me that McClellan had said
to him: "My friends have injured me a thousand times more than my
enemies." It was certainly true.</p>

<p>Now, seeing his features the first time, I scanned them anxiously for
lineaments of greatness. I saw a pleasant, mild, moony face, with
one cheek distended by tobacco; but nothing which appeared strong or
striking. Tinctured largely with the general belief in his military
genius, I imputed the failure only to my own incapacity for reading
"Nature's infinite book of secrecy."</p>

<p>One evening, at Cairo, a man, whose worn face, shaggy beard, matted
locks, and tattered clothing marked him as one of the constantly
arriving refugees, sought me and asked:</p>

<p>"Can you tell me the name of <cite>The Tribune</cite>
correspondent who passed through Memphis last February?"</p>

<p>He was informed that that pleasure had been mine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Loyal Girl's Assistance.</div>

<p>"Then," said he, "I have been lying in jail at Memphis about fifty
days chiefly on your account! The three or four letters which you
wrote from there were peculiarly bitter. Of course, I was not aware
of your presence, and I sent one to <cite>The Tribune</cite>, which
was also very emphatic. The Secessionists suspected me not only of
the one which I did write, but also of yours. They pounced on me and
put me in jail. After the disbanding of the Committee of Safety I
was brought before the City Recorder, who assured me from the bench
of his profound regrets that he could find no law for hanging <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
me! I would have been there until this time, but for the assistance
of a young lady, through whom I succeeded in bribing an officer of
the jail, and making my escape. I was hidden in Memphis for several
days, then left the city in disguise, and have worked my way, chiefly
on foot, aided by negroes and Union families, through the woods of
Tennessee and the swamps of Missouri up to God's country."</p>

<p>The refugee seemed to be not only in good health, but also in
excellent spirits, and I replied:</p>

<p>"I am very sorry for your misfortunes; but if the Rebels must have
one of us, I am very glad that it was not I."</p>

<p>Nearly four years later, this gentleman turned the tables on me very
handsomely. After my twenty months imprisonment in Rebel hands, among
a crowd of visitors he walked into my room at Cincinnati one morning,
and greeted me warmly.</p>

<p>"You do not remember me, do you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I recognize your face, but cannot recall your name."</p>

<p>"Well, my name is Collins. Once, when I escaped from the South, you
congratulated me at Cairo. Now, I congratulate you, and I can do it
with all my heart, in exactly the same words. I am very sorry for
your misfortunes; but if the Rebels must have one of us, I am very
glad that it was not I!"</p>

<p>After our troops captured Memphis, I encountered the young lady
who aided Mr. Collins in escaping. She was enthusiastically loyal,
but her feeling had been repressed for nearly two years, when the
arrival of our forces loosened her tongue. She began to utter her
long-stifled Union views, and it is my deliberate opinion that she
has not stopped yet. She is now the wife of an officer in the United
States service. </p>

<p class="quotdate">
   <span class="smcap">Cairo</span>, <i>May 29</i>.
</p>

<p>A drizzly, muddy, melancholy day. Never otherwise than forlorn,
Cairo is pre-eminently lugubrious during a mild rain. In dry
weather, even when glowing like a furnace, you may find amusement
in the contemplation of the high-water mark upon trees and houses,
the stilted-plank sidewalks, the half-submerged swamps, and other
diluvian features of this nondescript, saucer-like, terraqueous town.
You may speculate upon the exact amount of fever and ague generated
to the acre, or inquire whether the whisky saloons, which spring up
like mushrooms, are indigenous or exotic.</p>

<p>In downright wet weather you may calculate how soon the streets
will be navigable, and the effect upon the amphibious natives. It
is difficult to realize that anybody was ever born here, or looks
upon Cairo as home. Washington Irving records that the old Dutch
housewives of New York scrubbed their floors until many "grew to have
webbed fingers, like unto a duck." I suspect the Cairo babies must
have fins.</p>

<p>Long-suffering, much-abused Cairo! What wounds hast thou not
received from the Parthian arrows of tourists! "The season here,"
wrote poor John Phenix, bitterest of all, "is usually opened with
great <span lang="fr">&eacute;clat</span> by small-pox, continued
spiritedly by cholera, and closed up brilliantly with yellow fever.
Sweet spot!"</p>

<p>Theorists long predicted that the great metropolis of the Mississippi
valley&mdash;the granary of the world&mdash;must ultimately rise here. Many
proved their faith by pecuniary investments, which are likely to be
permanent.</p>

<p>Possessed by a similar delusion, Illinois, for years, strove to
legislate Alton into a vast commercial mart. But, in spite of their
unequaled geographical positions, Cairo and Alton still languish
in obscurity, while St.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
Louis and Cincinnati, twin queens of this imperial valley, succeed to
their grand heritage.</p>

<p>Nature settles these matters by laws which, though hidden, are
inexorable. Even that mysterious, semi-civilized race, which swarmed
in this valley centuries before the American Indian, established
their great centers of population where ours are to-day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Death of Douglas.</div>

<p class="quotdate"><i>June 4.</i></p>

<p>Intelligence of the death of Senator Douglas, received last evening,
excites profound and universal regret. Though totally unfamiliar
with books, Mr. Douglas thoroughly knew the masses of the Northwest,
down to their minutest sympathies and prejudices. Beyond any of his
cotemporaries, he was a man of the people, and the people loved him.
Never before could he have died so opportunely for his posthumous
fame. Nothing in his life became him like the leaving of it. His
last speech, in Chicago, was a fervid, stirring appeal for the
Union and the Government, and for crushing out treason with an iron
hand. His emphatic loyalty exerted great influence in Illinois. His
life-long opponents forget the asperities of the past, in the halo of
patriotism around his setting sun, and unite, with those who always
idolized him, in common tribute to his memory.</p>

<p>We have very direct intelligence from Tennessee. The western
districts are all Secession. Middle Tennessee is about equally
divided. East Tennessee, a mountain region, containing few slaves,
is inhabited by a hardy, primitive, industrious race. They are
thoroughly, enthusiastically loyal.<a name="FNanchor_11_11"

<div class="sidenote">A Clear-Headed Negro.</div>

<p>The felicitous decision of Major-General Butler, that slaves of the
enemy are "contraband of war," disturbs the Rebels not a little,
even in the West. A friend just from Louisiana, relates an amusing
conversation between a planter and an old, trusted slave.</p>

<p>"Sam," said his master, "I must furnish some niggers to go down and
work on the fortifications at the Balize. Which of the boys had I
better send?"</p>

<p>"Well, massa," replied the old servant, shaking his head oracularly,
"I doesn't know about dat. War's comin' on, and dey might be killed.
Ought to get Irishmen to do dat work, anyhow. I reckon you'd better

<p>Scores of fugitives from the South arrive here daily, with the old
stories of insult, indignity, and outrage. Several have come in with
their heads shaved. To you, my reader, who have never seen a case of
the kind, it may seem a trivial matter for a person merely to have
one side of his head laid bare, but it is a peculiarly repulsive
spectacle. The first time you look upon it, or on those worse cases,
where free-born men of Saxon blood bear fresh marks of the lash, you
will involuntarily clinch your teeth, and thank God that the system
which bears such infernal fruits is rushing upon its own destruction.</p>

<p class="quotdate"><i>June 8.</i></p>

<p>The heated term is upon us. We are amid upper, nether, and
surrounding fires. At eight, this morning, the mercury indicated
eighty degrees in the shade. How high it has gone since, I dare not
conjecture; but a friend insists that the sun will roast eggs to-day
upon any doorstep in town. I am a little incredulous as to that,
though a pair of smarting, half-blistered hands&mdash;the result of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
ten minutes' walk in its devouring breath&mdash;protest against absolute
unbelief. Officers who served in the War with Mexico declare they
never found the heat so oppressive in that climate as it is here. The
raw troops on duty, who are sweltering in woolen shirts and cloth
caps, bear it wonderfully well.</p>

<p>A number of Chicago ladies are already here, acting as nurses in the
hospital. The dull eyes of the invalids brighten at their approach,
and voices grow husky in attempting to express their gratitude.
According to Carlyle, "in a revolution we are all savages still;
civilization has only sharpened our claws;" but this tender care for
the soldier is the one redeeming feature of modern war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Review of the Troops.</div>

<p class="quotdate"><i>June 12.</i></p>

<p>A review of all the troops. The double ranks of well-knit men, with
shining muskets and bayonets, stretch off in perspective for more
than a mile. After preliminary evolutions, at the word of command,
the lines suddenly break and wheel into column by companies, and
marching commences. You see two long parallel columns of men moving
in opposite directions, with an open space between. Their legs, in
motion, look for all the world like the shuttles in some great Lowell
factory.</p>

<p>The artillerists fire each of their six-pounders three times a
minute. They discharge one, dismount it, lay it upon the ground,
remove the wheels from the carriage, drop flat upon their faces, then
spring up, remount the gun, ready for reloading or removing, all in
forty-five seconds.</p>

<p>Standing three hundred yards from the cannon, the column of smoke,
white at first, but rapidly changing to blue, shoots out twenty-five
or thirty feet from the muzzle before you hear the report. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>The flying flags, playing bands, galloping officers, long lines
of our boys in blue, and sharp metallic reports, impress you with
something of the pomp and circumstance of glorious war.</p>

<p>But Captain Jenny, a young engineer officer, quietly remarks, that
he once witnessed a review of seventy thousand French troops in the
Champ de Mars, and in 1859 saw the army of seventy-five thousand men
enter Paris, returning from the Italian wars. Colonel Wagner, an old
Hungarian officer, who has participated in twenty-three engagements,
assures you that he has looked upon a parade of one hundred and forty
thousand men, whereupon our little force of five thousand appears
insignificant. Nevertheless, it exceeds Jackson's recruits at New
Orleans, and is larger than the effective force of Scott during the
Mexican war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A "Runnin' Nigger!"</div>

<p>Our first contraband arrived here in a skiff last night, bearing
unmistakable evidences of long travel. He says he came from

party of soldiers. He answered my salutation with "Good evenin',

all over his face, and bowed all through his body, as he depressed
his head, slightly lifting his left foot, with the gesture which only

<p>"Well, uncle, have you joined the army?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mass'r" (with another African salaam).</p>

<p>"Are you going to fight?"</p>

colloquially known among the Illinois sovereigns of the prairie as
"Dick Oglesby."</p>

<p>Twenty miles below Cairo, we slowly passed the town of Columbus, Ky.,
on the highest bluffs of the Mississippi. The village is a straggling
collection of brick blocks, frame houses, and whisky saloons. It
contains no Rebel forces, though seven thousand are at Union City,
Tenn., twenty-five miles distant.</p>

<p>On a tall staff, a few yards from the river, a great Secession flag,
with its eight stars and three stripes, was triumphantly flying.</p>

<p>Turning back, after steaming two miles below, the boat was stopped
at the landing; the captain went on shore, cut down the flag, and
brought it on board, amid cheers from our troops. The Columbians
looked on in grim silence&mdash;all save four Union ladies, who,</p>

<p class="blockquot">
   "Faithful among the faithless only they,"
</p>

<p>waved handkerchiefs joyfully from a neighboring bluff.</p>

<p>Each star of the flag bore the name in pencil of the young lady
who sewed it on. The Maggies, and Julias, and Sues, and Kates, and
Sallies, who thus left their autographs upon their handiwork, did not
anticipate that it would so soon be scrutinized by Yankee soldiers.
And, doubtless, "Julia K----," the damsel whose star I pilfered,
scarcely aspired to the honor of furnishing a relic for <cite>The
Tribune</cite> cabinet. </p>

<div class="sidenote">The Retributions of Time.</div>

<p>On the 15th of June I returned from Cairo to St. Louis. Lyon had gone
up the Missouri River with an expedition, which was all fitted out
and started in a few hours. Lyon was very much in earnest, and he
knew the supreme value of time in the outset of a war.</p>

<p>How just are the retributions of history! Virginia originated State
Rights run-mad, which culminated in Secession. Behold her ground
between the upper and nether mill-stones! Missouri lighted the fires
of civil war in Kansas; now they blazed with tenfold fury upon her
own soil. She sent forth hordes to mob printing-presses, overawe the
ballot-box, substitute the bowie-knife and revolver for the civil
law. Now, her own area gleamed with bayonets; the Rebel newspaper was
suppressed by the file of soldiers, civil process supplanted by the
unpitying military arm.</p>

<p>Governor Claiborne F. Jackson, in 1855, led a raid into Kansas, which
overthrew the civil authorities, and drove citizens from the polls.
Now, the poisoned chalice was commended to his own lips. A hunted
fugitive from his home and his chair of office, he was deserted by
friends, ruined in fortune, and the halter waited for his neck.
Thomas C. Reynolds, late Lieutenant-Governor, by advocating the
right of Secession, did much to poison the public mind of the South.
He, too, found

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
his reward in disgrace and outlawry; unable to come
within the borders of the State which so lately delighted to do him
honor!</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Railroad Reminiscence.</div>

<p>I followed Lyon's Expedition by the Pacific railway. The president
of the road told me a droll story, which illustrates the folly
that governed the location of the railway system of Missouri. The
Southwest Branch is about a hundred miles long, through a very thinly
settled region. For the first week after the cars commenced running
over it, they carried only about six passengers, and no freight
except a live bear and a jar of honey. The honey was carried free,
and the freight on Bruin was fifty cents. Shut up in the single
freight car, during the trip, he ate all the honey! The company
were compelled to pay two dollars for the loss of that saccharine
esculent. Thus their first week's profits on freight amounted to
precisely one dollar and fifty cents on the wrong side of the ledger.</p>

<p>The Rebels had now evacuated Jefferson City, and our own troops,
commanded by Colonel B&oelig;rnstein, a German editor, author, and
theatrical manager, of St. Louis, were in peaceable possession. The
soldiers were cooking upon the grass in the rear of the Capitol,
standing in the shade of its portico and rotunda, lying on beds of
hay in its passages, and upon carpets in the legislative halls. They
reposed in all its rooms, from the subterranean vaults to the little
circular chamber in the dome.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Untainted with "B. Republicanism."</div>

<p>Governor and Legislature were fled. With Colonel B&oelig;rnstein, I went
through the executive mansion, which had been deserted in hot haste.
Sofas were overturned, carpets torn up and littered with letters
and public documents. Tables, chairs, damask curtains, cigar-boxes,
champagne-bottles, ink-stands, books, private letters, and family
knick-knacks, were scattered everywhere

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
in chaotic confusion. Some of the Governor's correspondence was
amusing. The first letter I noticed was a model of brevity. Here it
is&mdash;its virgin paper unsullied by the faintest touch of "B.
Republicanism."</p>

<p>There was a ludicrous disparity between the evidences of sudden
flight on all sides and the pompous language of the Governor's latest
State paper, which lay upon the piano in the drawing-room:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"Now, therefore, I, C. F. Jackson, Governor of the State
   of Missouri, do issue this my proclamation, calling the
   militia of the State, to the number of FIFTY THOUSAND, into
   the service of the State. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp; Rise, then,
   and drive out ignominiously the invaders!"</p>
</div>

<p>Beds were unmade, dishes unwashed, silver forks and spoons, belonging
to the State, scattered here and there. The only things that
appeared undisturbed were the Star Spangled Banner and the national
escutcheon, both frescoed upon the plaster of the gubernatorial
bedroom.</p>

<p>As we walked through the deserted rooms, a hollow echo answered to
the tramp of the colonel and his lieutenant, and to the dull clank of
their scabbards against the furniture.</p>

<p>General Lyon opened the war in the West by the battle of Booneville.
It lasted only a few minutes, and the undisciplined and half-armed
Rebel troops, after a faint show of resistance, retreated toward the
South. Lyon's command lost only eleven men. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Belligerent Chaplain.</div>

<p>During the engagement, the Rev. William A. Pile, Chaplain of the
First Missouri Infantry, with a detail of four men, was looking
after the wounded, when, coming suddenly upon a party of twenty-four
Rebels, he ordered them to surrender. Strangely enough, they laid
down their arms, and were all brought, prisoners, to General
Lyon's head-quarters by their five captors, headed by the reverend
representative of the Church militant and the Church triumphant.</p>

<p>Messrs. Thomas W. Knox and Lucien J. Barnes, army correspondents,
zealous to see the first battle, narrowly escaped with their
lives. Appearing upon a hill, surveying the conflict through their
field-glasses, they were mistaken by General Lyon for scouts of the
enemy. He ordered his sharpshooters to pick them off, when one of his
aids recognized them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Camp Tales of the Marvelous.</div>

<p>Are you fond of the marvelous? If so, here is a camp story about
Colonel Sigel's late engagement at Carthage:</p>

<p>A private in one of his companies (so runs the tale), while loading
and firing, was lying flat upon his face to avoid the balls of the
Rebels, when a shot from one of their six-pounders plunged into the
ground right beside him, plowed through under him, about six inches
below the surface, came out on the other side, and pursued its
winding way. It did not hurt a hair of his head, but, in something
less than a twinkling of an eye, whirled him over upon his back!</p>

<p>If you shake your head, save your incredulity for <em>this</em>: A captain
assures me that in the same battle he saw one of Sigel's artillerists
struck by a shot which cut off both legs; but that he promptly raised
himself half up, rammed the charge home in his gun, withdrew the
ramrod, and then fell back, dead! This is, at least, melo-dramatic,
and only paralleled by the ballad-hero</p>

<p>It was a relief to escape the excitement and bitterness of Missouri,
and spend a few quiet days in the free States. Despite Rebel
predictions, grass did not grow in the streets of Chicago. In
sooth, it wore neither an Arcadian nor a funereal aspect. Palatial
buildings were everywhere rising; sixty railway trains arrived and
departed daily; hotels were crowded with guests; and the voice of the
artisan was heard in the land. Michigan Avenue, the finest drive in
America, skirting the lake shore for a mile and a half, was crowded
every evening with swift vehicles, and its sidewalks thronged with
leisurely pedestrians. It afforded scope to one of the two leading
characteristics of Chicago residents, which are, holding the ribbons
and leaving out the latch-string.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Corn not Cotton is King.</div>

<p>I did not hear a single cry of "Bread or Blood!" As the city had
over two million bushels of corn in store, and had received eighteen
million bushels of grain during the previous six months, starvation
was hardly imminent. War or peace, currency or no currency,
breadstuffs will find a market. Corn, not cotton, is king; the great
Northwest, instead of Dixie Land, wields the sceptre of imperial
power.</p>

<p>The elasticity of the new States is wonderful. Wisconsin and Illinois
had lost about ten millions of dollars

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
through the depreciation of their currency within a few months. It
caused embarrassment and stringency, but no wreck or ruin.</p>

<p>Reminiscences of the financial chaos were entertaining. New York
exchange once reached thirty per cent. The Illinois Central Railroad
Company paid twenty-two thousand five hundred dollars <em>premium</em> on a
single draft. For a few weeks before the crash, everybody was afraid
of the currency, and yet everybody received it. People were seized
with a sudden desire to pay up. The course of nature was reversed;
debtors absolutely pursued their creditors, and creditors dodged
them as swindlers dodge the sheriff. Parsimonious husbands supplied
their wives bounteously with means to do family shopping for months
ahead. There was a "run" upon those feminine paradises, the dry-goods
stores, while the merchants were by no means anxious to sell.</p>

<p>Suddenly prices went up, as if by magic. Then came a grand crisis.
Currency dropped fifty per cent., and one morning the city woke up
to find itself poorer by just half than it was the night before. The
banks, with their usual feline sagacity, alighted upon their feet,
while depositors had to stand the loss.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Curious Reminiscences of Chicago.</div>

<p>Persons who settled in Chicago when it was only a military post, many
hundred miles in the Indian country, relate stories of the days when
they sometimes spent three months on schooners coming from Buffalo.
Later settlers, too, offer curious reminiscences. In 1855, a merchant
purchased a tract of unimproved land near the lake, outside the city
limits, for twelve hundred dollars, one-fourth in cash. Before his
next payment, a railroad traversed one sandy worthless corner of it,
and the company paid him damages to the amount of eleven hundred
dollars. Before the end of the third year, when

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
his last installment of three hundred dollars became due, he sold
the land to a company of speculators for twenty-one thousand five
hundred dollars. It is now assessed at something over one hundred
thousand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Visit to the Grave of Douglas.</div>

<p>On a July day, so cold that fires were comforting within doors, and
overcoats and buffalo robes requisite without, I visited the grave of
Senator Douglas, unmarked as yet by monumental stone. He rests near
his old home, and a few yards from the lake, which was sobbing and
moaning in stormy passion as the great, white-fringed waves chased
each other upon the sandy shore.</p>

<p>With the arrival of each railway train from the east, long files of
immigrants from Norway and northern Germany come pouring up Dearborn
street, gazing curiously and hopefully at their new Land of Promise.
One of the many railroad lines had brought twenty-five hundred within
two weeks. There were gray-haired men and young children. All were
attired neatly, especially the women, with snow-white kerchiefs about
their heads.</p>

<p>They were bound, mainly, for Wisconsin and Minnesota. Men and women
are the best wealth of a new country. Though nearly all poor, these
brought, with the fair hair and blue eyes of their fatherland,
honesty, frugality, and industry, as their contribution to that great
crucible which, after all its strange elements are fused, shall pour
forth the pure and shining metal of American Character.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Social Habits of the Germans.</div>

<p>Missouri, at the commencement of the war, had two hundred thousand
Germans in a population of little more than one million. Almost to a
man, they were loyal, and among the first who sprang to arms.</p>

<p>In the South, they were always regarded with suspicion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
The Rebels succeeded in dragooning but very few of them into their
ranks. Honor to the loyal Germans!</p>

<p>According to some unknown philosopher, "an Englishman or a Yankee
is capital; an Irishman is labor; but a German is capital and labor
both." Cincinnati, at the outbreak of the Rebellion, contained about
seventy thousand German citizens, who for many years had contributed
largely to her growth and prosperity.</p>

<p>A visit to their distinctive locality, called "Over the Rhine," with
its German daily papers, German signs, and German conversation, is a
peep at Faderland.</p>

<p>Cincinnati is nearer than Hamburg, the Miami canal more readily
crossed than the Atlantic, and that "sweet German accent," with which
General Scott was once enraptured, is no less musical in the Queen
City than in the land of Schiller and G&ouml;ethe. Why, then, should one
go to Germany, unless, indeed, like Bayard Taylor, he goes for a
wife? The multitudinous maidens&mdash;light-eyed and blonde-haired&mdash;in
these German streets, would seem to remove even that excuse.</p>

<p>When Young America becomes jovial, he takes four or five boon
companions to a drinking saloon, pours down half a glass of raw
brandy, and lights a cigar. Continuing this programme through
the day, he ends, perhaps, by being carried home on a shutter or
conducted to the watch-house.</p>

<p>But the German, at the close of the summer day, strolls with his
wife and two or three of his twelve children (the orthodox number in
well-regulated Teutonic families) to one of the great airy halls or
gardens abounding in his portion of the city. Calling for Rhein wine,
Catawba, or "<span lang="de">zwei glass lager bier und zwei pretzel</span>," they sit an
hour or two, chatting with friends, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
then return to their homes like rational beings after rational
enjoyment. The halls contain hundreds of people, who gesticulate more
and talk louder during their mildest social intercourse than the same
number of Americans would in an affray causing the murder of half the
company; but the presence of women and children guarantees decorous
language and deportment.</p>

<p>The laws of migration are curious. One is, that people ordinarily go
due west. The Massachusetts man goes to northern Ohio, Wisconsin,
or Minnesota; the Ohioan to Kansas; the Tennesseean to southern
Missouri; the Mississippian to Texas. Great excitements, like those
of Kansas and California, draw men off their parallel of latitude;
but this is the general law. Another is, that the Irish remain near
the sea-coast, while the Germans seek the interior. They constitute
four-fifths of the foreign population of every western city.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Early Days of Cincinnati.</div>

<p>In 1788, a few months before the first settlement of Cincinnati,
seven hundred and forty acres of land were bought for five hundred
dollars. The tract is now the heart of the city, and appraised at
many millions. As it passed from hand to hand, colossal fortunes were
realized from it; but its original purchaser, then one of the largest
western land-owners, at his death did not leave property enough to
secure against want his surviving son. Until 1862, that son resided
in Cincinnati, a pensioner upon the bounty of relatives. As, in the
autumn of life, he walked the streets of that busy city, it must have
been a strange reflection that among all its broad acres of which his
father was sole proprietor, he did not own land enough for his last
resting-place. "Give him a little earth for charity!"</p>

<p>Many high artificial mounds, circular and elliptical, stood here when
the city was founded. In after years,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
as they were leveled, one by one, they revealed relics of that
ancient and comparatively civilized race, which occupied this region
before the Indian, and was probably identical with the Aztecs of
Mexico.</p>

<p>Upon the site of one of these mounds is Pike's Opera House, a
gorgeous edifice, erected at an expense of half a million of dollars,
by a Cincinnati distiller, who, fifteen years before, could not
obtain credit for his first dray-load of whisky-barrels. It is one
of the finest theaters in the world; but the site has more interest
than the building. What volumes of unwritten history has that spot
witnessed, which supports a temple of art and fashion for the men
and women of to-day, was once a post from which Indian sentinels
overlooked the "dark and bloody ground" beyond the river, and,
in earlier ages, an altar where priests of a semi-barbaric race
performed mystic rites to propitiate heathen gods!</p>

<div class="sidenote">A City Founded by a Woman.</div>

<p>Cincinnati was built by a woman. Its founder was neither carpenter
nor speculator, but in the legitimate feminine pursuit of winning
hearts. Seventy years ago, Columbia, North Bend, and Cincinnati&mdash;all
splendid cities on paper&mdash;were rivals, each aspiring to be the
metropolis of the West. Columbia was largest, North Bend most
favorably located, and Cincinnati least promising of all.</p>

<p>But an army officer, sent out to establish a military post for
protecting frontier settlers against Indians, was searching for a
site. Fascinated by the charms of a dark-eyed beauty&mdash;wife of one
of the North Bend settlers&mdash;that location impressed him favorably,
and he made it head-quarters. The husband, disliking the officer's
pointed attentions, came to Cincinnati and settled&mdash;thus, he
supposed, removing his wife from temptation. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Aspirations of the Cincinnatian.</div>

<p>But as Mark Antony threw the world away for Cleopatra's lips, this
humbler son of Mars counted the military advantages of North Bend
as nothing compared with his charmer's eyes. He promptly followed
to Cincinnati, and erected Fort Washington within the present city
limits. Proximity to a military post settled the question, as it has
all similar ones in the history of the West. Now Cincinnati is the
largest inland city upon the continent; Columbia is an insignificant
village, and North Bend an excellent farm.</p>

<p>In architecture, Cincinnati is superior to its western rivals, and
rapidly gaining upon the most beautiful seaboard cities. Some of
its squares are unexcelled in America. A few public buildings are
imposing; but its best structures have been erected by private
enterprise. The Cincinnatian is expansive. Narrow quarters torture
him. He can live in a cottage, but he must do business in a palace.
An inferior brick building is the specter of his life, and a
freestone block his undying ambition.</p>

<p>From the Queen City I went to Louisville. Though communication with
the South had been cut off by every other route, the railroad was
open thence to Nashville.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Treason and Loyalty in Louisville.</div>

<p>Kentucky was disputed ground. Treason and Loyalty jostled each
other in strange proximity. At the breakfast table, one looked up
from his New York paper, forty-eight hours old, to see his nearest
neighbor perusing <cite>The Charleston Mercury</cite>. He found
<cite>The Louisville Courier</cite> urging the people to take up
arms against the Government. <cite>The Journal</cite>, published
just across the street, advised Union men to arm themselves, and
announced that any of them wanting first-class revolvers could
learn something to their advantage by calling upon its editor. In
the telegraph-office, the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164"
id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> loyal agent of the Associated
Press, who made up dispatches for the North, chatted with the
Secessionist, who spiced his news for the southern palate. On
the street, one heard Union men advocate the hanging of Governor
Magoffin, and declare that he and his fellow-traitors should find the
collision they threatened a bloody business. At the same moment, some
inebriated "Cavalier" reeled by, shouting uproariously "Huzza for
Jeff. Davis!"</p>

<p>Here, a group of pale, long-haired young men was pointed out as
enlisted Rebel soldiers, just leaving for the South. There, a
troop of the sinewy, long-limbed mountaineers of Kentucky and East
Tennessee, marched sturdily toward the river, to join the loyal
forces upon the Indiana shore. Two or three State Guards (Secession),
with muskets on their shoulders, were closely followed by a trio of
Home Guards (Union), also armed. It was wonderful that, with all
these crowding combustibles, no explosion had yet occurred in the
Kentucky powder-magazine.</p>

<p>While Secessionists were numerous, Louisville, at heart loyal,
everywhere displayed the national flag. Yet, although the people tore
to pieces a Secession banner, which floated from a private dwelling,
they were very tolerant toward the Rebels, who openly recruited for
the Southern service. Imagine a man huzzaing for President Lincoln
and advertising a Federal recruiting-office in any city controlled by
the Confederates!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prentice of the Louisville Journal.</div>

<p>"The real governor of Kentucky," said a southern paper, "is
not Beriah Magoffin, but George D. Prentice." In spite of his
"neutrality," which for a time threatened to stretch out to the
crack of doom, Mr. Prentice was a thorn in the side of the enemy.
His strong influence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
through <cite>The Louisville Journal</cite>, was felt throughout the
State.</p>

<p>Visiting his editorial rooms, I found him over an appalling pile of
public and private documents, dictating an article for his paper.
Many years ago, an attack of paralysis nearly disabled his right
hand, and compelled him ever after to employ an amanuensis.</p>

<p>His small, round face was fringed with dark hair, a little silvered
by age; but his eyes gleamed with their early fire, and his
conversation scintillated with that ready wit which made him the most
famous paragraphist in the world. His manner was exceedingly quiet
and modest. For about three-fourths of the year, he was one of the
hardest workers in the country; often sitting at his table twelve
hours a day, and writing two or three columns for a morning issue.</p>

<p>At this time, the Kentucky Unionists, advocating only "neutrality,"
dared not urge open and uncompromising support of the Government.
When President Lincoln first called for troops, <cite>The Journal</cite>
denounced his appeal in terms almost worthy of <cite>The Charleston
Mercury</cite>, expressing its "mingled amazement and indignation." Of
course the Kentuckians were subjected to very bitter criticism. Mr.
Prentice said to me:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"You misapprehend us in the North. We are just as much for the Union
   as you are. Those of us who pray, pray for it; those of us who fight,
   are going to fight for it. But we know our own people. They require
   very tender handling. Just trust us and let us alone, and you shall
   see us come out all right by-and-by."</p>
</div>

<p>The State election, held a few weeks after, exposed the groundless
alarm of the leading politicians. It resulted in returning to
Congress, from every district but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
one, zealous Union men. Afterward the State furnished troops whenever
they were called for, and, in spite of her timid leaders, finally
yielded gracefully to the inexorable decree of the war, touching her
pet institution of Slavery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">First Union Troops of Kentucky.</div>

<p>I paid a visit to the encampment of the Kentucky Union troops, on
the Indiana side of the Ohio, opposite Louisville. "Camp Joe Holt"
was on a high, grassy plateau. Unfailing springs supplied it with
pure water, and trees of beech, oak, elm, ash, maple, and sycamore,
overhung it with grateful shade. The prospective soldiers were lying
about on the ground, or reading and writing in their tents.</p>

<p>General Rousseau, who was sitting upon the grass, chatting with a
visitor, looked the Kentuckian. Large head, with straight, dark hair
and mustache; eye and mouth full of determination; broad chest, huge,
erect, manly frame.</p>

<p>His men were sinewy fellows, with serious, earnest faces. Most of
them were from the mountain districts. Many had been hunters from
boyhood, and could bring a squirrel from the tallest tree with their
old rifles. Byron's description of their ancestral backwoodsmen
seemed to fit them exactly:</p>

<div class="poem">
   <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i2">"And tall and strong and swift of foot were they,<br /></span>
      <span class="i4">Beyond the dwarfing city's pale abortions,<br /></span>
      <span class="i2">Because their thoughts had never been the prey<br /></span>
      <span class="i4">Of care or gain; the green woods were their portions.<br /></span>
      <span class="i2">Simple they were, not savage; and their rifles,<br /></span>
      <span class="i4">Though very true, were yet not used for trifles."<br /></span>
   </div>
</div>

<p>The history of this brigade was characteristic of the times. Rousseau
scouted "neutrality" from the outset. On the 21st of May, he said
from his place in the Kentucky Senate: </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"If we have a Government, let it be maintained and obeyed.
   If a factious minority undertakes to override the will of the
   majority and rob us of our constitutional rights, let it be put
   down&mdash;peaceably if we can, but forcibly if we must. * &nbsp;*
   &nbsp;* Let me tell you, sir, Kentucky will not 'go out!' She will
   not stampede. Secessionists must invent something new, before they
   can either frighten or drag her out of the Union. We shall be but
   too happy to keep peace, but we cannot leave the Union of our
   fathers. When Kentucky goes down, it will be in blood! Let that be
   understood."</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Struggle in the Kentucky Legislature.</div>

<p>In that Legislature, the struggle between the Secessionists and the
Loyalists was fierce, protracted, and uncertain. Each day had its
accidents, incidents, telegraphic and newspaper excitements, upon
which the action of the body seemed to depend.</p>

<p>In firm and determined men, the two parties were about equally
divided; but there were a good many "floats," who held the balance of
power. These men were very tenderly nursed by the Loyalists.</p>

<p>The Secessionists frequently proposed to go into secret session,
but the Union men steadfastly refused. Rousseau declared in the
Senate that if they closed the doors he would break them open. As he
stands about six feet two, and is very muscular, the threat had some
significance.</p>

<p>Buckner, Tighlman, and Hanson<a name="FNanchor_12_12"
id="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12"
class="fnanchor">12</a>&mdash;all afterward generals in the Rebel
army&mdash;led the Secessionists. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
professed to be loyal, and were very shrewd and plausible. They
induced hundreds of young men to join the State-Guard, which they
were organizing to force Kentucky out of the Union, though its
ostensible object was to assure "neutrality."</p>

<div class="sidenote">What Rebel Leaders Pretended.</div>

<p>"State Rights" was their watchword. "For Kentucky neutrality," first;
and, should the conflict be forced upon them, "For the South against
the North." They worked artfully upon the southern partiality for the
doctrine that allegiance is due first to the State, and only secondly
to the National Government.</p>

<p>Governor Magoffin and Lieutenant-Governor Porter were bitter Rebels.
The Legislature made a heavy appropriation for arming the State,
but practically displaced the Governor, by appointing five loyal
commissioners to control the fund and its expenditure.</p>

<p>In Louisville, the Unionists secretly organized the "Loyal League,"
which became very large; but the Secessionists, also, were noisy and
numerous, firm and defiant.</p>

<p>On the 5th of June, Rousseau started for Washington, to obtain
authority to raise troops in Kentucky. At Cincinnati, he met Colonel
Thomas J. Key, then Judge-Advocate of Ohio, on duty with General
McClellan. Key was alarmed, and asked if it were not better to keep
Kentucky in the Union by voting, than by fighting. Rousseau replied:</p>

<p>"As fast as we take one vote, and settle the matter, another, in some
form, is proposed. While we are voting, the traitors are enlisting
soldiers, preparing to throttle Kentucky and precipitate her into
Revolution as they have the other southern States. It is our duty to
see that we are not left powerless at the mercy of those who will
butcher us whenever they can." </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Rousseau's Visit to Washington.</div>

<p>Key declared that he would ruin every thing by his rashness.
By invitation, Rousseau called on the commander of the Western
Department. During the conversation, McClellan remarked that Buckner
had spent the previous night with him. Rousseau replied that Buckner
was a hypocrite and traitor. McClellan rejoined that he thought him
an honorable gentleman. They had served in Mexico together, and were
old personal friends.</p>

<p>He added: "But I did draw him over the coals for saying he would not
only drive the Rebels out of Kentucky, but also the Federal troops."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said Rousseau, "it would once have been considered
pretty nearly treason for a citizen to fight the United States army
and levy war against the National Government!"</p>

<p>When Rousseau reached Washington, he found that Colonel Key, who
had frankly announced his determination to oppose his project, was
already there. He had an interview with the President, General
Cameron, and Mr. Seward. The weather was very hot, and Cameron sat
with his coat off during the conversation.</p>

<p>As usual, before proceeding to business, Mr. Lincoln had his "little
story" to enjoy. He shook hands cordially with his visitor, and
asked, in great glee:</p>

<p>"Rousseau, where did you get that joke about Senator Johnson?"</p>

<p>"The joke, Mr. President, was too good to keep. Johnson told it
himself."</p>

<p>It was this: Dr. John M. Johnson, senator from Paducah, wrote to Mr.
Lincoln a rhetorical document, in the usual style of the Rebels. In
behalf of the sovereign State, he entered his solemn and emphatic
protest against the planting of cannon at Cairo, declaring that
the guns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
actually pointed in the direction of the sacred soil of Kentucky!</p>

<div class="sidenote">His Interview with President Lincoln.</div>

<p>In an exquisitely pithy autograph letter, Mr. Lincoln replied, if he
had known earlier that Cairo, Illinois, was in Dr. Johnson's Kentucky
Senatorial District, he certainly should not have established either
the guns or the troops there! Singularly enough&mdash;for a keen sense of
humor was very rare among our "erring brethren"&mdash;Johnson appreciated
the joke.</p>

<p>While Rousseau was urging the necessity of enlisting troops, he
remarked:</p>

<p>"I have half pretended to submit to Kentucky neutrality, but, in
discussing the matter before the people, while apparently standing
upon the line, I have almost always <em>poked</em>."</p>

<p>This word was not in the Cabinet vocabulary. General Cameron looked
inquiringly at Mr. Lincoln, who was supposed to be familiar with the
dialect of his native State.</p>

<p>"General," asked the President, "you don't know what 'poke' means?
Why, when you play marbles, you are required to shoot from a mark on
the ground; and when you reach over with your hand, beyond the line,
that is <em>poking!</em>"</p>

<p>Cameron favored enlistments in Kentucky, without delay. Mr. Lincoln
replied:</p>

<p>"General, don't be too hasty; you know we have seen another man
to-day, and we should act with caution." Rousseau explained:</p>

<p>"The masses in Kentucky are loyal. I can get as many soldiers as are
wanted; but if the Rebels raise troops, while we do not, our young
men will go into their army, taking the sympathies of kindred and
friends, and may finally cause the State to secede. It is of vital
importance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
that we give loyal direction to the sentiment of our people."</p>

<p>At the next interview, the President showed him this indorsement on
the back of one of his papers:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"When Judge Pirtle, James Gu<ins>th</ins>rie, George D. Prentice,
   Harney, the Speeds, and the Ballards shall think it proper to raise
   troops for the United States service in Kentucky, Lovell H. Rousseau
   is authorized to do so."</p>
</div>

<p>"How will that do, Rousseau?"</p>

<p>"Those are good men, Mr. President, loyal men; but perhaps some of
the rest of us, who were born and reared in Kentucky, are just as
good Union men as they are, and know just as much about the State. If
you want troops, I can raise them, and I will raise them. If you do
not want them, or do not want to give me the authority, why that ends
the matter."</p>

<p>Finally, through the assistance of Mr. Chase, who steadfastly favored
the project, and of Secretary Cameron, the authority was given.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Timidity of Kentucky Unionists.</div>

<p>A few Kentucky Loyalists were firm and outspoken. But General Leslie
Coombs was a good specimen of the whole. When asked for a letter to
Mr. Lincoln, he wrote: "Rousseau is loyal and brave, but a little too
much for coercion for these parts."</p>

<p>After Rousseau returned, with permission to raise twenty
companies, <cite>The Louisville Courier</cite>, whose veneer of
loyalty was very thin, denounced the effort bitterly. Even <cite>The
Louisville Journal</cite> derided it until half a regiment was in
camp.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Loyalty of Judge Lusk.</div>

<p>A meeting of leading Loyalists of the State was held in Louisville,
at the office of James Speed, since Attorney General of the United
States. Garrett Davis, Bramlette, Boyle, and most of the Louisville
men,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
were against the project. They feared it would give the State
to the Secessionists at the approaching election. Speed and the
Ballards were for it. So was Samuel Lusk, an old judge from Garrard
County, who sat quietly as long as he could during the discussion,
then jumped up, and bringing his hand heavily down on the table,
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Can't have two regiments for the old flag! By ---! sir, he shall have
thirty!"</p>

<p>A resolution was finally adopted that, when the time came, they all
wished Rousseau to raise and command the troops, but that, for the
present, it would be impolitic and improper to commence enlisting in
Kentucky.</p>

<p>Greatly against his own will, and declaring that he never was so
humiliated in his life, Rousseau established his camp on the Indiana
shore. After the election, some Secession sympathizers, learning
that he proposed to bring his men over to Louisville, protested very
earnestly, begging him to desist, and thus avoid bloodshed, which
they declared certain.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said he, "my men, like yourselves, are Kentuckians. I
am a Kentuckian. Our homes are on Kentucky soil. We have organized
in defense of our common country; and bloodshed is just the business
we are drilling for. If anybody in the city of Louisville thinks it
judicious to begin it when we arrive, I tell you, before God, you
shall all have enough of it before you get through!"</p>

<p>The next day he marched his brigade unmolested through the city.
Afterward, upon many battle-fields, its honorable fame and Rousseau's
two stars were fairly won and worthily worn. </p>

<div class="sidenote">Campaigning in the Kanawha Valley.</div>

<p>I spent the last days of July, in Western Virginia, with the command
of General J. D. Cox, which was pursuing Henry A. Wise in hot haste
up the valley of the Kanawha. There had been a few little skirmishes,
which, in those early days, we were wont to call battles.</p>

<p>Like all mountain regions, the Kanawha valley was extremely loyal.
Flags were flying, and the people manifested intense delight at the
approach of our army. We were very close upon the flying enemy;
indeed, more than once our cavalry boys ate hot breakfasts which the
Rebels had cooked for themselves.</p>

<p>At a farm-house, two miles west of Charleston, a dozen natives were
sitting upon the door-step as our column passed. The farmer shook
hands with us very cordially. "I <em>am</em> glad to see the Federal army,"
said he; "I have been hunted like a dog, and compelled to hide in the
mountains, because I loved the Union." His wife exclaimed, "Thank
God, you have come at last, and the day of our deliverance is here. I
always said that the Lord was on our side, and that he would bring us
through safely."</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Bloodthirsty Female Secessionist.</div>

<p>Two of the women were ardent Rebels. They did not blame the
native-born Yankees, but wished that every southerner in our ranks
might be killed. Just then one of our soldiers, whose home was in
that county, passed by the door-step, on his way to the well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
for a canteen of water. One of the women said to me, with eyes that
meant it:</p>

<p>"I hope <em>he</em> will be killed! If I had a pistol I would shoot him.
Why! you have a revolver right here in your belt, haven't you? If I
seen it before, I would have used it upon him!"</p>

<p>Suggesting that I might have interfered with such an attempt, I asked:</p>

<p>"Do you think you could hit him?"</p>

<p>"O, yes! I have been practicing lately for just such a purpose."</p>

<p>Her companion assured me that she prayed every night and morning for
Jefferson Davis. If his armies were driven out of Virginia, she would
go and live in one of the Gulf States. She had a brother and a lover
in General Wise's army, and gave us their names, with a very earnest
request to see them kindly treated, should they be taken prisoners.
When we parted, she shook my hand, with: "Well, I hope no harm will
befall you, if you <em>are</em> an Abolitionist!"</p>

<p>An old citizen, who had been imprisoned for Union sentiments, was
overcome with joy at the sight of our troops. He mounted a great rock
by the roadside, and extemporized a speech, in which thanks to the
Union army and the Lord curiously intermingled.</p>

<p>Women, with tears in their eyes, told us how anxiously they had
waited for the flag; how their houses had been robbed, their husbands
hunted, imprisoned, and impressed. Negroes joined extravagantly in
the huzzaing, swinging flags as a woodman swings his ax, bending
themselves almost double with shouts of laughter, and exclamations of
"Hurrah for Mass'r Lincoln!"</p>

<p>Thirteen miles above Charleston, at the head of navigation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
we left behind what we grandiloquently called "the fleet." It
consisted of exactly four little stern-wheel steamboats.</p>

<p>The people of these mountain regions use the old currency of New
England, and talk of "fourpence ha'pennies" and "ninepences."</p>

<p>Our road continued along the river-bank, where the ranges of
overhanging hills began to break into regular, densely timbered,
pyramidal spurs. The weather was very sultry. How the sun smote us
in that close, narrow valley! The accoutrement's of each soldier
weighed about thirty pounds, and made a day's march of twenty miles
an arduous task.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Woman in Disguise.</div>

<p>A private who had served in the First Kentucky Infantry<a
name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13" href="#Footnote_13_13"
class="fnanchor">13</a> for three months, proved to be of the wrong
sex. She performed camp duties with great fortitude, and never fell
out of the ranks during the severest marches. She was small in
stature, and kept her coat buttoned to her chin. She first excited
suspicion by her feminine method of putting on her stockings; and
when handed over to the surgeon proved to be a woman, about twenty
years old. She was discharged from the regiment, but sent to Columbus
upon suspicion, excited by some of her remarks, that she was a spy
of the Rebels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Extravagant Joy of the Negroes.</div>

<p>At Cannelton, a hundred slaves were employed in the coal-oil
works&mdash;two long, begrimed, dilapidated buildings, with a few wretched
houses hard by. Nobody was visible, except the negroes. When I asked
one of them&mdash;"Where are all the white people?" he replied, with a
broad grin&mdash;</p>

<p>"Done gone, mass'r." </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>A black woman, whom we encountered on the road, was asked:</p>

<p>"Have you run away from your master?"</p>

<p>"Golly, no!" was the prompt answer, "mass'r run away from <em>me</em>!"</p>

<p>The slaves, who always heard the term "runaway" applied only to their
own race, were not aware that it could have any other significance.
After the war opened, its larger meaning suddenly dawned upon them.
The idea of the master running away and the negroes staying, was
always to them ludicrous beyond description. The extravagant lines of
"Kingdom Coming," exactly depicted their feelings:</p>

<p>"Dey tole us," said a group of blacks, "dat if your army cotched us,
you would cut off our right feet. But, Lor! we knowed you wouldn't
hurt <em>us</em>!"</p>

<p>At a house where we dined, the planter assuming to be loyal, one of
our officers grew confidential with him, when a negro woman managed
to beckon me into a back room, and seizing my arm, very earnestly
said: "I tell you, mass'r's only just putting on. He hates you all,
and wants to see you killed. Soon as you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
have passed, he will send right to Wise's army, and tell him what you
mean to do; if any of you'uns remain here behind the troops, you will
be in danger. He's in a heap of trouble," she added, "but, Lord, dese
times just suits <em>me</em>!"</p>

<p>At another house, while the Rebel host had stepped out for a moment,
an intelligent young colored woman, with an infant in her arms,
stationed two negro girls at the door to watch for his return, and
interrogated me about the progress and purposes of the War. "Is it
true," she inquired, very sadly, "that your army has been hunting and
returning runaway slaves?"</p>

<p>Thanks to General Cox, who, like the sentinel in Rolla, "knew
his duty better," I could reply in the negative. But when, with
earnestness gleaming in her eyes, she asked, if, through these
convulsions, any hope glimmered for her race, what could I tell her
but to be patient, and trust in God?</p>

<div class="sidenote">How the Soldiers Foraged.</div>

<p>Army rations are not inviting to epicurean tastes; but in the field
all sorts of vegetables and poultry were added to our bill of
fare. Chickens, young pigs, fence-rails, apples, and potatoes, are
legitimate army spoils the world over.</p>

<p>"Where did you get that turkey?" asked a captain of one of his
men. "Bought it, sir," was the prompt answer. "For how much?"
"Seventy-five cents." "Paid for it, did you?" "Well, no, sir; told
the man I would pay <em>when we came back</em>!"</p>

<p>"Mass'r," said a little ebony servant to a captain with whom I was
messing, "I sees a mighty fine goose. Wish we had him for supper."</p>

<p>"Ginger," replied the officer, "have I not often told you that it is
very wicked to steal?"</p>

<p>The little negro laughed all over his face, and fell out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
of the ranks. By a "coincidence," worthy of Sam Weller, we supped on
stewed goose that very evening.</p>

<p>Seen by night from the adjacent hills, our picturesque encampments
gave to the wild landscape a new beauty. In the deep valleys gleamed
hundreds of snowy tents, lighted by waning camp-fires, round which
grotesque figures flitted. The faint murmur of voices, and the
ghostly sweetness of distant music, filled the summer air.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Falls of the Kanawha.</div>

<p>At the Falls of the Kanawha the river is half a mile wide. A natural
dam of rocks, a hundred yards in breadth, and, on its lower side,
thirty feet above the water, extends obliquely across the stream&mdash;a
smooth surface of gray rock, spotted with brown moss.</p>

<p>Near the south bank is the main fall, in the form of a half circle,
three or four hundred yards long, with a broken descent of thirty
feet. Above the brink, the water is dark, green, and glassy, but at
the verge it looks half transparent, as it tumbles and foams down the
rocks, lashed into a passion of snowy whiteness. Plunging into the
seething caldron, it throws up great jets and sheets of foam. Above,
the calm, shining water extends for a mile, until hidden by a sudden
bend in the channel. The view is bounded by a tall spur, wrapped
in the sober green of the forest, with an adventurous corn-field
climbing far up its steep side. At the narrow base of the spur, a
straw-colored lawn surrounds a white farm-house, with low, sloping
roof and antique chimneys. It is half hidden among the maples, and
sentineled by a tall Lombardy poplar.</p>

<p>Two miles above the fall, the stream breaks into its two chief
confluents&mdash;the New River and the Gauley. Hawk's Nest, near their
junction, is a peculiarly romantic spot. In its vicinity our command
halted. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
far from its base, and Wise ran too fast for capture. We had five
thousand troops, who were ill-disciplined and discontented. General
Cox was then fresh from the Ohio Senate. After more field experience,
he became an excellent officer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Tragedy of Slavery.</div>

<p>When I returned through the valley, I found Charleston greatly
excited. A docile and intelligent mulatto slave, of thirty years,
had never been struck in his life. But, on the way to a hayfield,
his new overseer began to crack his whip over the shoulders of the
gang, to hurry them forward. The mulatto shook his head a little
defiantly, when the whip was laid heavily across his back. Turning
instantly upon the driver, he smote him with his hayfork, knocking
him from his horse, and laying the skull bare. The overseer, a large,
athletic man, drew his revolver; but, before he could use it, the
agile mulatto wrenched it away, and fired two shots at his head,
which instantly killed him. Taking the weapon, the slave fled to the
mountains, whence he escaped to the Ohio line.</p>

the exhaustless soil has produced that staple abundantly for fifty

<p>No inland city ever held such a position as this. Here is the heart
of the unequaled valley, which extends from the Rocky Mountains to
the Alleghanies, and from the great lakes to the Gulf. Here is the
mighty river, which drains a region six times greater than the empire
of France, and bears on its bosom the waters of fifty-seven navigable
streams. Even the rude savage called it the "Father of Waters," and
early Spanish explorers reverentially named it the "River of the Holy
Ghost."</p>

<p>St. Louis, "with its thriving young heart, and its old French limbs,"
is to be the New York of the interior. The child is living who will
see it the second city on the American continent.</p>

<p>Three Rebel newspapers have recently been suppressed. The editor of
one applied to the provost-marshal for permission to resume, but
declined to give a pledge that no disloyal sentiment should appear in
its columns. He was very tender of the Constitution, and solicitous
about "the rights of the citizen." The marshal replied:</p>

<p>"I cannot discuss these matters with you. I am a soldier, and obey
orders."</p>

<p>"But," remonstrated the editor, "you might be ordered to hang me."</p>

<p>"Very possibly," replied the major, dryly.</p>

<p>"And you would obey orders, then?"</p>

<p>"Most assuredly I would, sir."</p>

<p>The Secession journalist left, in profound disgust. </p>

<div class="sidenote">The Battle of Wilson Creek.</div>

<p>On the 10th of August, at Wilson Creek, two hundred and forty miles
southwest of St. Louis, occurred the hardest-fought battle of the
year. General Lyon had pursued the Rebels to that corner of the
State. He had called again and again for re-enforcements, but at
Washington nothing could be seen except Virginia. Lyon's force
was five thousand two hundred men. The enemy, under Ben McCulloch
and Sterling Price, numbered over eleven thousand, according to
McCulloch's official report. Lyon would not retreat. He thought that
would injure the Cause more than to fight and be defeated.</p>

<p>To one of his staff-officers, the night before the engagement, he
said: "I believe in presentiments, and, ever since this attack was
planned, I have felt that it would result disastrously. But I cannot
leave the country without a battle."</p>

<p>On his way to the field, he was silent and abstracted; but when the
guns opened, he gave his orders with great promptness and clearness.</p>

<p>He had probably resolved that he would not leave the field alive
unless he left it as a victor. By a singular coincidence, the two
armies marched out before daybreak on that morning each to attack
the other. They met, and for many hours the tide of battle ebbed and
flowed.</p>

<p>Lyon's little army fought with conspicuous gallantry.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
It contained the very best material. The following is a

<div class="sidenote">Daring Exploit of a Kansas Officer.</div>

<p>During the battle, Captain Powell Clayton's company of the First
Kansas Volunteers, becoming separated from the rest of our forces,
was approached by a regiment uniformed precisely like the First Iowa.
Clayton had just aligned his men with this new regiment, when he
detected small strips of red cloth on the shoulders of the privates,
which marked them as Rebels. With perfect coolness, he gave the order:</p>

<p>"Right oblique, march! You are crowding too much upon this regiment."</p>

<p>By this maneuver his company soon placed a good fifty yards between
itself and the Rebel regiment, when the Adjutant of the latter rode
up in front, suspicious that all was not right. Turning to Clayton,
he asked:</p>

<p>"What troops are these?" </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>"First Kansas," was the prompt reply. "What regiment is that?"</p>

<p>"Fifth Missouri, Col. Clarkson."</p>

<p>"Southern or Union?"</p>

<p>"Southern," said the Rebel, wheeling his horse; but Clayton seized
him by the collar, and threatened to shoot him if he commanded his
men to attack. The Adjutant, heedless of his own danger, ordered his
regiment to open fire upon the Kansas company. He was shot dead on
the spot by Clayton, who told his men to run for their lives. They
escaped with the loss of only four.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Death of Lyon.</div>

<p>Toward evening Lyon's horse was killed under him. Immediately
afterward, his officers begged that he would retire to a less exposed
spot. Scarcely raising his eyes from the enemy, he said:</p>

<p>"It is well enough that I stand here. I am satisfied."</p>

<p>While the line was forming, he turned to Major Sturgis, who stood
near him, and remarked:</p>

<p>"I fear that the day is lost. I think I will lead this charge."</p>

<p>Early in the day he had received a flesh-wound in the leg, from which
the blood flowed profusely. Sturgis now noticed fresh blood on the
General's hat, and asked where it came from.</p>

<p>"It is nothing, Major, nothing but a wound in the head," replied
Lyon, mounting a fresh horse.</p>

<p>Without taking the hat that was held out to him by Major Sturgis, he
shouted to the soldiers:</p>

<p>"Forward, men! I will lead you."</p>

<p>Two minutes later he lay dead on the field, pierced by a rifle-ball
through the breast, just above the heart.</p>

<p>Our officers held a hurried consultation, and decided not only to
retreat, but to abandon southwest Missouri. Strangely enough, the
coincidence of the morning was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
here repeated. Almost simultaneously, the Rebels decided to fall
back. They were in full retreat when they were arrested by the
news of the departure of the Federal troops, and returned to take
possession of the field which the last Union soldier had abandoned
eight hours before.</p>

<p>They claimed a great victory, and with justice, as they finally held
the ground. Their journals were very jubilant. Said <cite>The New Orleans
Picayune</cite>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"Lyon is killed, Sigel in flight; southwestern Missouri is clear
   of the National scum of invaders. The next word will be, 'On to St.
   Louis.' That taken, the whole power of Lincolnism is broken in the
   West, and instead of shouting 'Ho for Richmond!' and 'Ho for New
   Orleans!' there will be hurrying to and fro among the frightened
   magnates at Washington, and anxious inquiries of what they shall do
   to save themselves from the vengeance to come. Heaven smiles on the
   armies of the Confederate States."</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Lyon's Courage and Patriotism.</div>

<p>Lyon went into the battle in civilian's dress, excepting only a
military coat. He had on a soft hat of ashen hue, with long fur and
very broad brim, turned up on three sides. He had worn it for a
month; it would have individualized the wearer among fifty thousand
men. His peculiar dress and personal appearance were well known
through the enemy's camp. He received a new and elegant uniform just
before the battle, but it was never worn until his remains were
clothed in it, after the brave spirit had fled, and while our forces
were retreating from Springfield by night.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his personal bravery and military education, he
always opposed dueling on principle. No provocation made him
recognize the "code." Once he was struck in the face, but he had
courage enough to refuse to challenge his adversary. For a time
this subjected him to misapprehension and contempt among military
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
men, but, long before his death, his fellow-officers understood and
respected him.</p>

<p>He seemed to care little for personal fame&mdash;to think only of the
Cause. Knowing exactly what was before him, he went to death on that
summer evening "as a man goes to his bridal." Losing a life, he
gained an immortality. His memory is green in the nation's heart, his
name high on her roll of honor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrival of General Fremont.</div>

<p>On the 25th of July, Major-General John C. Fremont reached St.
Louis, in command of the Western Department. His advent was hailed
with great enthusiasm. The newspapers, West, predicted for him
achievements extravagant and impossible as those which the New York
journals had foretold for McClellan. In those sanguine days, the
whole country made "Young Napoleons" to order.</p>

<p>With characteristic energy, Fremont plunged into the business of his
new department, where chaos reigned, and he had no spell to evoke
order, save the boundless patriotism and earnestness of the people.</p>

<p>His head-quarters were established on Chouteau Avenue. He was overrun
with visitors&mdash;every captain, or corporal, or civilian, seeking to
prosecute his business with the General in person. He was therefore
compelled to shut himself up, and, by the sweeping refusal to admit
petitioners to him, a few were excluded whose business was important.
Some dissatisfaction and some jesting resulted. I remember three
Kansas officers, charged with affairs of moment, who used daily to be
merry, describing how they had made a reconnoissance toward Fremont's
head-quarters, fought a lively engagement, and driven in the pickets,
only to find the main garrison so well guarded that they were quite
unable to force it. </p>

<div class="sidenote">Union Families Driven Out.</div>

<p class="quotdate">
   <span class="smcap">St. Louis</span>, <i>August 26, 1861</i>.
</p>

<p>A long caravan of old-fashioned Virginia wagons, containing rude
chairs, bedsteads, and kitchen utensils, passed through town
yesterday. They brought from the Southwest families who,</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"Forced from their homes, a melancholy train, are seeking in free
   Illinois that protection which Government is unable to afford them in
   Missouri. At least fifty thousand inoffensive persons have thus fled
   since the Rebellion."</p>
</div>

<p class="quotdate"><i>August 29.</i></p>

<p>We were lately surprised and gratified to learn that a gentleman
from Minnesota had offered an unasked loan of forty-six thousand
dollars to the Government authorities&mdash;gratified at such spontaneous
patriotism, and surprised that any man who lived in Minnesota
should have forty-six thousand dollars. The latter mystery has been
explained by the discovery that he never took his funds to that
vortex of real estate speculation, but left them in this city, where
he formerly resided. Moreover, his money was in Missouri currency,
which, though at par here in business transactions, is at a discount
of eight per cent. on gold and New York exchange. The loan is to be
returned to him in gold. So, after all, there is probably as much
human nature to the square acre in Minnesota as anywhere else.</p>

<p class="quotdate"><i>September 6.</i></p>

<p>"Egypt to the rescue!" is the motto upon the banner of a new Illinois
regiment. Southern Illinois, known as Egypt, is turning out men for
the Mississippi campaign with surprising liberality; whereupon a
fiery Secessionist triumphantly calls attention to this prophetic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
text, from Hosea: "Egypt shall gather them up; Memphis shall bury
them!"</p>

<p>The aptness of the citation is admirable; but he is reminded, in
return, that the pet phrase of the Rebels, "Let us alone," was the
prayer of a man possessed of a devil, to the Saviour of the world!</p>

<div class="sidenote">An Involuntary Sojourn With Rebels.</div>

<p>I have just met a gentleman, residing in southwestern Missouri, whose
experience is novel. He visited the camp of the Rebels to reclaim a
pair of valuable horses, which they had taken from his residence.
They not only retained the stolen animals, but also took from him
those with which he went in pursuit, and left him the alternative
of walking home, twenty-three miles, through a dangerous region, or
remaining in their camp. Fond of adventure, he chose the latter,
and for three weeks messed with a Missouri company. The facetious
scoundrels told him that they could not afford to keep him unless he
earned his living; and employed him as a teamster. He had philosophy
enough to make the best of it, and flattered himself that he became a
very creditable mule-driver.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of August 10th, he was breakfasting with the
officers from a dry-goods box, which served for a table, when bang!
went a cannon, not more than two or three hundred yards from them,
and crash! came a ball, cutting off the branches just above their
heads. "Here is the devil to pay; the Dutch are upon us!" exclaimed
the captain, springing up and ordering his company to form.</p>

<p>My friend was a looker-on from the Southern side during the whole
battle. He gives a graphic account of the joy of the Rebels at
finding the body of General Lyon, lying under a tree (the first
information they had of his death), and their surprise and
consternation at the bravery with which the little Union army fought
to the bitter end. </p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>Twenty leading Secessionists are in durance vile here. There is

slave-pen, and that they are enabled to study State Rights from old
negro quarters.</p>

<p class="quotdate"><i>September 7.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Startling Confederate Atrocity.</div>

<p>The Rebels have just perpetrated a new and startling atrocity. They
cut down the high railroad bridge over the Little Platte River
near St. Joseph. The next train from Hannibal reached the spot at
midnight, and its locomotive and five cars were precipitated, thirty
feet, into the bed of the river. More than fifty passengers were
dangerously wounded, and twenty instantly killed. They were mainly
women and children; there was not a single soldier among them.</p>

<p class="quotdate"><i>September 15.</i></p>

<p>General Fremont is issuing written guarantees for their freedom
to the slaves of Rebels. They are in the form of real-estate
conveyances, releasing the recipient from all obligations to his
master; declaring him forever free from servitude, and with full
right and authority to control his own labor. They are headed "Deed
of Manumission," authenticated by the great seal of the Western
Department, and the signature of its commander. Think of giving a man
a warranty-deed for his own body and soul!</p>

<p>In compliance with imperative orders from the Government, several
regiments, though sadly needed here, are being sent eastward. To the
colonel commanding one of them, the order was conveyed by Fremont in
these characteristic terms:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"Repair at once to Washington. Transportation is provided for you.
   My friend, I am sorry to part with you, but there are laurels growing

   <span class="smcap">Organization of the "Bohemian Brigade."</span>
</div>

<p>In October, General Fremont's forming army rendezvoused at the
capital of Missouri. From afar, Jefferson City is picturesque; but
distance lends enchantment. Close inspection shows it uninviting and
rough. The Capitol, upon a frowning hill, is a little suggestive of
the sober old State House which overlooks Boston Common. Brick and
frame houses enough for a population of three thousand straggle over
an area of a mile square, as if they had been tossed up like a peck
of apples, and left to come down and locate themselves. Many are half
hidden by the locust, ailantus, and arbor-vit&aelig; trees, and the white
blossoms of the catalpas.</p>

<p>The war correspondents "smelled the battle from afar off." More than
twenty collected two or three weeks before the army started. Some of
them were very grave and decorous at home, but here they were like
boys let out of school.</p>

<p>They styled themselves the Bohemian Brigade, and exhibited that
touch of the vagabond which Irving charitably attributes to all
poetic temperaments. They were quartered in a wretched little tavern
eminently First Class in its prices. It was very southern in style.
A broad balcony in front, over a cool brick pavement; no two rooms
upon the same level; no way of getting up stairs except by going out
of doors; long, low wings, shooting off in all directions; a gallery
in the rear, deeper than the house itself; heavy furniture,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
from the last generation, with a single modern link in the shape of
a piano in the ladies' parlor; leisurely negro waiters, including
little boys and girls, standing behind guests at dinner, and waving
long wands over the table to disconcert the omnipresent flies; and
corn bread, hot biscuits, ham, and excellent coffee. The host and
hostess were slaveholders, who said "thar" and "whar," but held that
Secessionists were traitors, and that traitors ought to be hung.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An Amused African.</div>

<p>The landlord, who was aged, rheumatic, and half blind, labored
under the delusion that he kept the house; but an intelligent
and middle-aged slave, yclept John, was the real brain of the
establishment.</p>

<p>"John," asked one of the correspondents, "does your master really
think he is alive?"</p>

<p>"'Live, sir? I reckon so."</p>

<p>"Why, he has been dead these twenty years. He hobbles around,
pretending he exists, just to save funeral expenses."</p>

<p>John's extravagant enjoyment of this sorry jest beggared description.
He threw himself on the floor, rolled over and over, and roared with
laughter for fifteen minutes. He did not recover his usual gravity
for weeks. Again and again, while waiting upon guests, he would
see his master coming, and suddenly explode with merriment, to the
infinite amazement of the <span lang="fr">habitu&eacute;s</span> of the house, who suspected that
the negro was losing his wits.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Diversions of the Correspondents.</div>

<p>The Bohemians took their ease in their inn, and held high carnival,
to the astonishment of all its <span lang="fr">attach&eacute;s</span>, from the aged proprietor
down to the half-fledged negro cherubs. Each seemed to regard as his
personal property the half-dozen rooms which all occupied. The one
who dressed earliest in the morning would appropriate the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
first hat, coat, and boots he found, remarking that the owner was
probably dead.</p>

<p>One huge, good-natured brother they called "the Elephant." He was
greatly addicted to sleeping in the daytime; and when other resources
failed, some reckless quill-driver would say:</p>

<p>"Now, let's all go and sleep with the Elephant."</p>

<p>Eight or ten would pile themselves upon his bed, beside him and upon
him, until his good-nature became exhausted, when the giant would
toss them out of the room like so many pebbles, and lock his door.</p>

<p>There was little work to be done; so they discussed politics,
art, society, and metaphysics; and would soon kindle into singing,
reciting, "sky-larking," wrestling, flinging saddles, valises, and
pillows. In some recent theatrical spectacle, two had heard a "chorus
of fiends," which tickled their fancy. As the small hours approached,
it was their unceasing delight to roar imitations of it, declaring,
with each repetition, that it was now to be given positively for
the last time, and by the very special request of the audience. How
they sent that demoniac "Ha! ha! ha!" shrieking through the midnight
air! The following account of their diversions was given by "J. G."
in <cite>The Cincinnati Gazette</cite>. The scenes he witnessed
suggested, very naturally, the nomenclature of the prize-ring:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>Happening to drop in the other night, I found the representatives
   of <cite>The Missouri Republican</cite>, <cite>The Cincinnati
   Commercial</cite>, <cite>The New York World</cite>, and <cite>The
   Tribune</cite>, engaged in a hot discussion upon matrimony,
   which finally ran into metaphysics. <cite>The Republican</cite>
   having plumply disputed an abstruse proposition of <cite>The
   Tribune</cite>, the latter seized an immense bolster, and
   brought it down with emphasis upon the glossy pate of his
   antagonist. This instantly broke up the debate, and a general
   <span lang="fr">m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</span> commenced. <cite>The
   Republican</cite> grabbed a damp towel and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
   aimed a stunning blow at his assailant, which missed him and
   brought up against the nasal protuberance of <em>Frank Leslie</em>.
   The exasperated <em>Frank</em> dealt back a pillow, followed by
   a well-packed knapsack. Then <cite>The Missouri Democrat</cite>
   sent a coverlet, which lit upon and enveloped the knowledge-box of
   <cite>The Herald</cite>. The latter disengaged himself after several
   frantic efforts, and hurled a ponderous pair of saddle-bags, which
   passed so close to <cite>The Gazette's</cite> head, that in dodging
   it he bumped his phrenology against the bed-post, and raised a
   respectable organ where none existed before. Simultaneously <cite>The
   Commercial</cite> threw a haversack, which hit <cite>Harper</cite>
   in the bread-basket, and doubled him into a folio&mdash;knocking
   him against <cite>The World</cite>, who, toppling from his center
   of gravity, was poising a plethoric bed-tick with dire intent, when
   the upturned legs of a chair caught and tore it open, scattering the
   feathers through the surging atmosphere. In falling, he capsized
   the table, spilling the ink, wrecking several literary barks,
   extinguishing the "brief candle" that had faintly revealed the
   sanguinary fray, thus abruptly terminating hostilities, but leaving
   the panting heroes still defiant and undismayed. A light was at
   last struck; the combatants adjusted their toilets, and, having lit
   the calumets of peace, gently resigned themselves to the soothing
   influence of the weed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Polite Army Chaplain.</div>

<p>They did not learn, for several days, that a meek chaplain, with his
wife and three children, inhabited an adjacent apartment. He was at
once sent for, and a fitting apology tendered. He replied that he had
actually enjoyed the novel entertainment. He must have been the most
polite man in the whole world. He is worthy a niche in biography,
beside the lady who was showered with gravy, by Sidney Smith, and
who, while it was still dripping from her chin, blandly replied to
his apologies, that not a single drop had touched her!</p>

<p>When in-door diversions failed, the correspondents amused themselves
by racing their horses, which were all fresh and excitable. That
region, abounding in hills, ravines, and woods, is peculiarly
seductive to reckless equestrians desiring dislocated limbs or broken
necks.</p>

<p>One evening, the "Elephant" was thrown heavily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
from his horse, and severely lamed. The next night, nothing daunted,
he repeated the race, and was hurled upon the ground with a force
which destroyed his consciousness for three or four hours. A comrade,
in attempting to stop the riderless horse, was dragged under the
heels of his own animal. His mild, protesting look, as he lay flat
upon his back, holding in both hands the uplifted, threatening foot
of his fiery Pegasus, was quite beyond description. One correspondent
dislocated his shoulder, and went home from the field before he heard
a gun.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sights in Jefferson City.</div>

<p class="quotdate">
   <span class="smcap">Jefferson City, Mo.</span>, <i>October 6, 1861</i>.
</p>

<p>These deep ravines and this fathomless mud offer to obstinate mules
unlimited facilities for shying, and infinite possibilities of
miring. Last night, six animals and an army wagon went over a small
precipice, and, after a series of somersaults, driver, wagon, and
mules, reached the bottom, in a very chaotic condition.</p>

<p>Jefferson is strong on the wet weather question. When Lyon got here
in June, he was welcomed by one man with an umbrella. When Fremont
arrived, a few nights ago, he was taken in charge by the same
gentleman, who was floundering about through the mud with a lantern,
seeking, not an honest man, but quarters for the commanding general.</p>

<p>Most of the troops have gone forward, but some remain. Newly mounted
officers, who sit upon their steeds much as an elephant might walk a
tight rope, dash madly through the streets, fondly dreaming that they
witch the world with noble horsemanship. Subalterns show a weakness
for brass buttons, epaulettes, and gold braid, which leaves feminine
vanity quite in the shade.</p>

<p>In the camps, the long roll is sometimes sounded at midnight, to
accustom officers and men to spring to arms.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
Upon the first of these sudden calls from Morpheus to Mars, the negro
servant of a staff-officer was so badly frightened that he brought
up his master's horse with the crupper about the neck instead of the
tail. The mistake was discovered just in season to save the rider
from the proverbial destiny of a beggar on horseback.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"<span class="smcap">Fights mit Sigel.</span>"</div>

<p>Here is a German private very shaky in the legs; he swears by Fremont
and "fights mit Sigel." Too much "lager" is the trouble with <em>him</em>;
and, in serene though harmless inebriety, he is arrested by a file
of soldiers. A capital print in circulation represents a native and
a German volunteer, with uplifted mugs of the nectar of Gambrinus,
striking hands to the motto, "One flag, one country, <span lang="de">zwei lager!</span>"</p>

<p>Here is a detachment of Home Guards, whose "uniform is multiform."
To a proposition, that the British militia should never be ordered
out of the country, Pitt once moved the satirical proviso, "Except
in case of invasion." So it is alleged that the Missouri Home Guards
are very useful&mdash;except in case of a battle; and I hear one merciless
critic style them the "Home Cowards." This is unjust; but they
illustrate the principle, that to attain good drill and discipline,
soldiers should be beyond the reach of home.</p>

<p>Camp Lillie, upon a beautiful grassy slope, is the head-quarters
of the commander. In his tent, directing, by telegraph, operations
throughout this great department, or upon horseback, personally
inspecting the regiments, you meet the peculiarly graceful, slender,
compact, magnetic man whose assignment here awoke so much enthusiasm
in the West. General Fremont is quiet, well-poised, and unassuming.
His friends are very earnest, his enemies very bitter. Those who know
him only by his early exploits, are surprised to find in the hero of
the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>

<p>but it did blanch under the absorbing labors and anxieties of two
months&mdash;a physiological fact which Doctor Holmes will be good enough
to explain to us at his earliest convenience.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fremont is in camp, but will return to Saint Louis when the
army moves. She inherits many traits of her father's character.
She possesses that "excellent thing in woman," a voice, like Annie
Laurie's, low and sweet&mdash;more rich, more musical, and better
modulated, than that of any <span lang="fr">trag&eacute;dienne</span> upon the stage. To a
broad, comprehensive intellect she adds those quick intuitions which
leap to results, anticipating explanations, and those proclivities
for episode, incident, and bits of personal analyzing, which make a
woman's talk so charming.</p>

<p>How much rarer this grace of familiar speech than any other
accomplishment whatever! In a lifetime one meets not more than four
or five great conversationalists. Jessie Benton Fremont is among the
felicitous few, if not queen of them all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sigel, Hunter, Pope, Asboth, McKinstry.</div>

<p>Sigel is slender, pale, wears spectacles, and looks more like a

broke out.</p>

<p>Hunter, at sixty, and agile as a boy, is erect and grim, with bald
head and Hungarian mustache.</p>

<p>Pope is heavy, full-faced, brown-haired, and looks like a man of
brains.</p>

<p>Asboth is tall, daring-eyed, elastic, a mad rider, and profoundly
polite, bowing so low that his long gray hair almost sweeps the
ground.</p>

<p>McKinstry is six feet two, sinewy-framed, deep-chested, firm-faced,
wavy-haired, and black-mustached. He looks like the hero of a
melodrama, and the Bohemians term him "the heavy tragedian."</p>

   <span class="smcap">Warsaw, Mo.</span>, <i>October 22</i>.
</p>

<p>An officer of New York mercantile antecedents, recently appointed
to a high position, reached Syracuse a few days since, under orders
to report to Fremont. He would come no farther than the end of the
railroad, but turned abruptly back to St. Louis. Being asked his
reason, he made this reply, peculiarly ingenuous and racy for a
brigadier-general and staff-officer:</p>

<p>"Why, I found that I should have to go on horseback!"</p>

<p>With two fellow-journalists, I left Syracuse four days ago. Asboth's
and Sigel's divisions had preceded us. The post-commandant would not
permit us to come through the distracted, guerrilla-infested country
without an escort, but gave us a sergeant and four men of the regular
army.</p>

<p>On the way we spent the supper hour near Cole Camp. Our Falstaffian
landlord informed us that two brothers, Jim and Sam Cole, encamped
here in early
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
days, to hunt bears, and that the creek was named in remembrance of
them. Being asked with great gravity the extremely Bohemian question,
"<em>Which</em> of them?" he relapsed into a profound study, from which he
did not afterward recover.</p>

<p>We made the trip&mdash;forty-seven miles&mdash;in ten hours. This is a strong
Secession village. Half its male inhabitants are in the Rebel army.
Our officers quarter in the most comfortable residences. At first
the people were greatly incensed at the "Abolition soldiery,"
but they now submit gracefully. One of the most malignant Rebel
families involuntarily entertains a dozen German officers, who drink
lager-beer industriously, smoke meerschaums unceasingly, and at night
sing unintermittently.</p>

<p>We are quartered at the house of a lady who has a son in Price's
army, and a daughter in whom education and breeding maintain constant
warfare with her antipathies toward the Union forces. Being told
the other evening that one of our party was a Black Republican, she
regarded him with a wondering stare, declaring that she never saw an
Abolitionist before in her life, and apparently amazed that he wore
the human face divine!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sigel's Transportation Train.</div>

<p>Sigel, as usual, is thirty miles ahead. He has more <em>go</em> in him
than any other of our generals. Several division commanders are
still waiting for transportation, but Sigel collected horse-wagons,
ox-wagons, mule-wagons, family-carriages, and stage-coaches, and
pressed animals until he organized a most unique transportation train
three or four miles long. He crossed his division over the swift
Osage River&mdash;three hundred yards wide&mdash;in twenty-four hours, upon a
single ferry-boat. The Rebels justly name him "The Flying Dutchman."</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Countryman's Estimate of Troops.</div>

<p>The Missourians along our line of march have very extravagant ideas
about the Federal army. We stopped at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
the house of a native, where ten thousand troops had passed. He
placed their number at forty thousand!</p>

<p>"I reckon you have, in all, about seventy thousand men, and three
hundred cannon, haven't you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We have a hundred and fifty thousand men, and six hundred pieces of
artillery," replied a wag in the party.</p>

<p>"Well," said the countryman, thoughtfully, "I reckon you'll clean out
old Price <em>this</em> time!" </p>

<div class="sidenote">A "Kid-Gloved" Corps.</div>

<p>General Fremont's Body Guard was composed of picked young men of
unusual intelligence. They were all handsomely uniformed, efficiently
armed, and mounted upon bay horses. They cultivated the mustache,
with the rest of the face smooth&mdash;at least, not a more whimsical
decree than the rigid regulation of the British army, which compelled
every man to shave and wear a stock under the burning sun of the
Crimea. Many denounced the Guard as a "kid-gloved," ornamental corps,
designed only to swell Fremont's retinue.</p>

<p>Major Zagonyi, commandant of the Guard, with one hundred and fifty of
his men, started with orders to reconnoiter the country in front of
us. When near Springfield, they found the town held by a Rebel force
of cavalry and infantry, ill organized, but tolerably armed, and
numbering two thousand.</p>

<p>Zagonyi drew his men up in line, explained the situation, and asked
whether they would attack or turn back for re-enforcements. They
replied unanimously that they would attack.</p>

<p>They <em>did</em> attack. Men and horses were very weary. They had ridden
fifty miles in seventeen hours; they had never been under fire
before; but history hardly parallels their daring.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Charge of the Body Guard.</div>

<p>The Rebels formed in line of battle at the edge of a wood. To
approach them, the Guard were compelled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
to ride down a narrow lane, exposed to a terrible fire from three
different directions. They went through this shower of bullets,
dismounted, tore down the high zig-zag fence, led their horses over
in the teeth of the enemy, remounted, formed, and, spreading out,
fan-like, charged impetuously, shouting "Fremont and the Union."</p>

<p>The engagement was very brief and very bloody. Though only in the
proportion of one to thirteen, the Guard behaved as if weary of their
lives. Men utterly reckless are masters of the situation. At first,
the Confederates fought well; but they were soon panic-stricken, and
many dropped their guns, and ran to and fro like persons distracted.</p>

<p>The Guard charged through and through the broken ranks of the Rebels,
chased them in all directions&mdash;into the woods, beyond the woods,
down the roads, through the town&mdash;and planted the old flag upon the
Springfield court-house, where it had not waved since the death of
Lyon.</p>

<p>Armed with revolvers and revolving carbines, members of the Guard had
twelve shots apiece. After delivering their first fire, there was no
time to reload, and (the only instance of the kind early in the war)
nearly all their work was done with the saber. When they mustered
again, almost every blade in the command was stained with blood.</p>

<p>Of their one hundred and fifty horses, one hundred and twenty were
wounded. A sergeant had three horses shot under him. A private
received a bullet in a blacking-box, which he carried in his pocket.
They lost fifty men, sixteen of whom were killed on the spot.</p>

<p>"I wonder if they will call us fancy soldiers and kid-gloved boys any
longer?" said one, who lay wounded in the hospital when we arrived. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Turning the Tables.</div>

<p>On a cot beside him, I found an old schoolmate. His eye brightened as
he grasped my hand.</p>

<p>"Is your wound serious?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Painful, but not fatal. O, it was a glorious fight!"</p>

<p>It <em>was</em> a glorious fight. Wilson Creek is doubly historic ground.
There first a thousand of our men poured out their blood like water,
and the brave Lyon laid down his life "for our dear country's sake."
Two months later, the same stream witnessed the charge of the Body
Guard, which, in those dark days, when the Cause looked gloomy,
thrilled every loyal heart in the nation. It will shine down the
historic page, and be immortal in song and story.</p>

<p>Major Frank J. White, of our army, was with the Rebels as a prisoner
of war during the charge. Just before they were routed, fourteen men,
under a South Carolina captain, started with him for General Price's
camp. At a house where they spent the night, the farmer boldly
avowed himself a Union man. He supposed White to be one of the Rebel
officers; but, finding a moment's opportunity, the major whispered to
him:</p>

<p>"I am a Union prisoner. Send word to Springfield at once, and my men
will come and rescue me."</p>

<p>The Rebels, leaving one man on picket outside, went to bed in the
same room with their prisoner. Then the farmer sent his little boy of
twelve years, on horseback, fourteen miles to Springfield. At three
o'clock in the morning, twenty-six Home Guards surrounded the house,
and captured the entire party. Major White at once took command, and
posted <em>his</em> guards over the crestfallen Confederates.</p>

<p>While they sat around the fire in the evening, waiting for supper,
the Rebel captain had remarked:</p>

<p>"Major, we have a little leisure, and I believe I will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
amuse myself by looking over your papers." Whereupon he spent an hour
in examining the letters which he found in White's possession. In
the morning, when the party, again sitting by the fire, waited for
breakfast, the major said, quietly:</p>

<p>"Captain, we have a little leisure, and I think I will amuse
myself by looking over <em>your</em> papers." So the Rebel documents were
scrutinized in turn. White returned in triumph to Springfield,
bringing his late captors as prisoners. A friendship sprang up
between him and the South Carolina captain, who remained on parole in
our camp for several days, and they messed and slept together.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Welcome from Union Residents.</div>

<p>When our troops entered Springfield, the people greeted them with
uncontrollable joy; for they were intensely loyal, and had been under
Rebel rule more than eleven weeks. Scores and scores of National
flags now suddenly emerged from mysterious hiding-places; wandering
exiles came pouring back, and we were welcomed by hundreds of glad
faces, waving handkerchiefs, swinging hats, and vociferous huzzas.</p>

<p>Fremont had now modified his Proclamation; but the logic of events
was stronger than President Lincoln. The negroes would throng our
camp, and Fremont never permitted a single one to be returned. One
slave appropriated a horse, and, guiding him only by a rope about the
nose, without saddle or bridle, blanket or spur, rode from Price's
camp to Fremont's head-quarters, more than eighty miles, in eighteen
hours.</p>

<p>A brigade of regular troops, under General Sturgis, having marched
from Kansas City, joined us in Springfield. They were under very
rigid discipline, and all their supplies, whether procured from
Rebels or Unionists, were paid for in gold. Sturgis was then very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
"conservative," and some of our people denounced him as disloyal.
But, like hundreds of others, inexorable war educated him very
rapidly. His sympathies were soon heartily on our side. He afterward,
in the Army of the Potomac, won and wore bright laurels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Freaks of the Kansas Brigade.</div>

<p>The Kansas volunteer brigade, under General "Jim" Lane, also
joined us at Springfield. Their course contrasted sharply with that
of Sturgis's men. They had a good many old scores to settle up, and
they swept along the Missouri border like a hurricane. Sublimely
indifferent to the President's orders, and all other orders which
did not please them, they received over two thousand slaves, sending
them off by installments into Kansas. When the master was loyal,
they would gravely appraise the negro; give him a receipt for his
slave, named ----, valued at ---- hundred dollars, "lost by the march
of the Kansas Brigade," and advise him to carry the claim before
Congress!</p>

<p>By some unexplained law, dandies, fools, and supercilious braggarts
often gravitate into staff positions; but Fremont's staff was an
exceedingly agreeable one. Many of its members had traveled over
the globe, and, from their wide experiences, whiled away many hours
before the evening camp-fires.</p>

<p>On the 31st of October, the correspondents, under cavalry escort,
visited the Wilson Creek battle-ground, ten miles south of
Springfield.</p>

<p>The field is broken by rocky ridges and deep ravines, and covered
with oak shrubs. Picking his way among the brushwood, my horse's
hoof struck with a dull, hollow sound against a human skull. Just
beyond, still clad in uniform, lay a skeleton, on whose ghastliness
the storms and sunshine of three months had fallen. The head was
partially severed; and though the upturned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
face was fleshless, I could not resist the impression that it wore a
look of mortal agony. It was in a little thicket, several yards from
the scene of any fighting. The poor fellow was carried there, dying
or dead, during the progress of the battle, and afterward overlooked.
Among our lost his name was probably followed by the sad word
"Missing."</p>

<p>Many graves had been opened by wolves. Bones of horses, haversacks,
shoes, blouses, gun-barrels, shot, and fragments of shell, were
scattered over the field. The trees were scarred with bullets, and
hundreds were felled by the artillery. A six-inch shot would cut down
one of these brittle oaks a foot in diameter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Capture of a Female Spy.</div>

<p>A few miles south of Springfield one of our scouts encountered a
young woman on horseback. Suspecting her errand, he informed her
confidentially that he was a spy from Price's army, who had been
several days in Fremont's camp. Falling into this palpable trap,
the girl told him frankly that <em>she</em> was sent by Price to visit
our forces, and obtain information. She was taken immediately to
Fremont's head-quarters. Her terror was very great on finding herself
betrayed. She told all she knew about the Rebels, and was finally
allowed to depart in peace. The employment of female spies was very
common upon both sides. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fremont's Farewell to his Army.</div>

<p>On the 2d of November our whole army was at Springfield. Fremont
had progressed farther south than any other Union commander, from
the Atlantic to the Rio Grande. Detachments of Rebels were within
ten miles of our camps. Emphatic, but entirely false reports from
the colonel at the head of Fremont's scouts,<a name="FNanchor_14_14"
id="FNanchor_14_14" href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>
had given the impression that Price's entire command was very near
us; and a great battle was hourly expected.</p>

<p>Fremont was in the midst of an important campaign. His army was most
patriotic, enthusiastic, and promising. His personal popularity among
his troops was without parallel.</p>

<p>At this moment the official ax fell. He received an order to
turn over his command to Hunter. It was a trying ordeal, but he
did a soldier's duty, obeying silently and instantly. The first
intelligence which the army received was conveyed by this touching
farewell:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p><span class="smcap">Soldiers of the Mississippi Army</span>:
   Agreeably to orders this day received, I take leave of you. Although
   our army has been of sudden growth, we have grown up together, and
   I have become familiar with the brave and generous spirit which you
   bring to the defense of your country, and which makes me anticipate
   for you a brilliant career.</p>

   <p>Continue as you have begun, and give to my successor the same
   cordial and enthusiastic support with which you have encouraged me.
   Emulate the splendid example already before you, and let me remain,
   as I am, proud of the noble army which I have thus far labored to
   bring together.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Disaffection among the Soldiers.</div>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>Soldiers! I regret to leave you. Sincerely I thank you for the
   regard and confidence you have invariably shown me. I deeply regret
   that I shall not have the honor to lead you to the victory which you
   are just about to win, but I shall claim to share with you in the joy
   of every triumph, and trust always to be fraternally remembered by my
   companions in arms.</p>
</div>

<p>Fremont's name had been the rallying-point of the volunteers.
Officers and entire regiments had come from distant parts of the
country to serve under him. All felt the impropriety and cruelty
of his removal at this time. Many officers at once wrote their
resignations. Whole battalions were reported laying down their arms.
The Germans were specially indignant, and among the Body Guard there
was much bitterness.</p>

<p>The slightest encouragement or tolerance from the General would
have produced wide-spread mutiny; but he expostulated with the
malcontents, reminding them that their first duty was to the country;
and, after Hunter's arrival, left the camp before daylight, lest
his appearance among the soldiers, as he rode away, should excite
improper demonstrations.</p>

<p>A few days moderated the feeling of the troops; for, like all our
volunteers, they were wedded not to any man, but to the Cause.</p>

<p>In St. Louis, Fremont was received more like a conquering hero
than a retiring general. An immense assembly greeted him. In their
enthusiasm, the people even carpeted his door-step with flowers.</p>

<p>For weeks before his removal the air had been filled with clamors,
charging him with incompetency, extravagance, and giving Government
contracts to corrupt men. The first attacks upon him immediately
followed his Emancipation Proclamation, issued August 31, 1861.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spurious Missouri Unionists.</div>

<p>There were many half-hearted Unionists in Missouri.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
For example, shortly after the capture of Sumter, General Robert
Wilson, of Andrew County, in a public meeting, served upon the
committee on resolutions reporting the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"<em>Resolved</em>, That we condemn as inhuman and diabolical the war
   being waged by the Government against the South."</p>
</div>

<p>Eight months after, this same Wilson claimed to be a Union leader,
and, as such, was sent to represent Missouri in the Senate of the
United States! Of course all men of this class waged unrelenting war
upon Fremont. Afterward there was a rupture among the really loyal
men; a fierce quarrel, in which the able but unscrupulous Blairs
headed the opposition, and some zealous and patriotic Unionists
co-operated with them. The President, always conscientious, was
persuaded to remove the General; but afterward tacitly admitted its
injustice by giving him another command.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln also countermanded the Emancipation Proclamation, which
was a little ahead of the times. Still it gratified the plain
people, even then. Tired of the tender and delicate terms in which
our authorities were wont to speak of "domestic institutions" and
"systems of labor," they were delighted to read the announcement in
honest Saxon:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"The property of active Rebels is confiscated for the
   public use; and their slaves, if any they have, are hereby
   declared Free Men."</p>
</div>

<p>It was a new and pure leaf in the history of the war.</p>

<p>Of course Fremont made mistakes, though the abuses in his department
were infinitely less than those which disgraced Washington, and which
in some degree are inseparable from large, unusual disbursements of
public money. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Conduct of Cameron and Thomas.</div>

<p>But he was very earnest. He was quite ignorant of How Not to Do it.
He took grave responsibilities. When red tape hampered him, he cut
it. Unable to obtain arms at Washington&mdash;which, in those days, knew
only Virginia&mdash;he ransacked the markets of the world for them. When
a paymaster refused to liquidate one of his bills, on the ground of
irregularity, he arrested him, and threatened to have him shot if he
persisted. Able to leave but few troops in St. Louis, he fortified
the city in thirty days, employing five thousand laborers.</p>

<p>Secretary Cameron and Adjutant-General Thomas visited Missouri,
after Fremont started upon his Springfield campaign. General Thomas
did not hesitate, in railway cars and hotels, to condemn him
violently&mdash;a gross breach of official propriety, and clearly tending
to excite insubordination among the soldiers. Cameron dictated a
letter, ordering Fremont to discontinue the St. Louis fortifications
as unnecessary, informing him that his official debts would not
be discharged till investigated, his contracts recognized, or the
officers paid whom he had appointed under the written authority of
the President.</p>

<p>In due time they <em>were</em> recognized and paid. The St. Louis
fortifications proved needful, and were afterward finished. Yet
Cameron permitted the contents of this letter to be telegraphed
all over the country four days before Fremont received it. It
seemed designed to impugn his integrity, destroy his credit,
promote disaffection in his camps, and prevent his contractors from
fulfilling their engagements. Thomas officially reported that Fremont
would not be able to move his army for lack of transportation. Before
the report could reach Washington, the army had advanced more than a
hundred miles! </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Disregard of the Army Regulations.</div>

<p>Time, which at last makes all things even, vindicated Fremont's
leading measures in Missouri. His subsequent withdrawal from the
field, in Virginia, was doubtless unwise. It was hard to be placed
under a junior and hostile general; but private wrongs must wait in
war, and resignation proves quite as inadequate a remedy for the
grievances of an officer, as Secession for the fancied wrongs of the
Slaveholders.</p>

<p>Brigadier-General Justus McKinstry, ex-Quartermaster of the
Western Department, was arrested, and closely confined in the
St. Louis arsenal for many months. His repeated demands for the
charges and specifications against him were disregarded. He was at
last court-martialed and dismissed the service, on the charge of
malfeasance in office. Brigadier-General Charles P. Stone was for a
long time kept under arrest in the same manner. These proceedings
flagrantly violated both the Army Regulation, entitling officers to
know the charges and witnesses against them, within ten days after
arrest, and the spirit of the Constitution itself, which guarantees
to every man a speedy public trial in the presence of his accusers.</p>

<p>Equally reprehensible was the arrest and long confinement of many
civilians without formal charges or trial. States where actual
war existed, and even the debatable ground which bordered them,
might be proper fields for this exercise of the Military Power.
But the friends of the Union, holding Congress, and nearly every
State Legislature by overwhelming majorities, could make whatever
laws they pleased; therefore, these measures were unnecessary and
unjustifiable in the North, hundreds of miles from the seat of war.
Utterly at variance with personal rights and republican institutions,
they were alarming and dangerous precedents, which any unscrupulous
future
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
administration may plausibly cite in defense of the grossest
outrages. President Lincoln was always very chary of this exercise
of arbitrary power; but some of his constitutional advisers were
constantly urging it. Secretary Stanton, in particular, advocated and
committed acts of flagrant despotism. He was a good patent-office
lawyer, but had not the faintest conception of those primary
principles of Civil Liberty which underlie English and American
institutions. Even the Magna Charta, in sonorous Latin, declared:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"No person shall be apprehended or imprisoned, except by the
   legal judgment of his peers, or the law of the land. To none will
   we sell, to none will we deny, to none will we <em>delay</em> right or
   justice."</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Military Power and the Press.</div>

<p>Kindred questions arose touching the Military Power and the Liberty
of the Press. Each northern city had its daily journal, which, under
thin disguise of loyalty, labored zealously for the Rebels. Soldiers
could not patiently read treasonable sheets. On several occasions
military commanders suppressed them, but the President promptly
removed the disability. The sober second thought of the people
was, that if editors and publishers in the loyal North could not
be convicted and punished in the civil courts, they should not be
molested.</p>

<p>General Hunter, succeeding Fremont, evacuated southwestern Missouri.
Before leaving Springfield, besieged with applications for runaway
slaves, he issued orders to deliver them up; but soldiers and
officers in his camps hid them so safely that they could not be found
by their masters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rudeness of General Halleck.</div>

<p>Hunter's little brief authority lasted just fifteen days, when he
was succeeded by General Halleck&mdash;a stout, heavy-faced, rather
stupid-looking officer, who wore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
civilian's dress, and resembled a well-to-do tradesman. On the 20th
of November appeared his shameful General Order Number Three:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"It has been represented that important information respecting
   the numbers and condition of our forces is conveyed to the enemy by
   means of fugitive slaves who are admitted within our lines. In order
   to remedy this evil, it is directed that no such persons be hereafter
   permitted to enter the lines of any camp, or of any forces on the
   march, and that any now within our lines be immediately excluded
   therefrom."</p>
</div>

<p>Its inhumanity outraged the moral sense, and its falsehood the common
sense, of the country. The negroes were uniformly friends to our
soldiers. After diligent inquiry from every leading officer of my
acquaintance, I could not learn a single instance of treachery. To
the cruelty of turning the slave away, Halleck added the dishonesty
of slandering him.</p>

<p>When Charles James Fox was canvassing for Par<del>lia-</del>liament, one of his
auditors said to him:</p>

<p>"Sir, I admire your talents, but d--n your politics!"</p>

<p>Fox retorted: "Sir, I admire your frankness, but d--n your manners!"</p>

<p>Many who had official business with Halleck uttered similar
maledictions. To his visitors he was brusque to surliness. Dr. Holmes
says, with great truth, that all men are bores when we do not want
them. Like all public characters, Halleck was beset by those grievous
dispensations of Providence. But a general in command of half a
continent ought, at least, to have the manners of a gentleman; and he
was sometimes so insulting that his legitimate visitors would have
been justified in kicking him down stairs. None of our high officials
equaled him in rudeness, except Mr. Stanton, Secretary of War.</p>

<p>In January, as a Government steamer approached the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
landing at Commerce, Missouri, two women on shore shouted to the
pilot:</p>

<p>"Don't land! Jeff. Thompson and his soldiers are here waiting for
you."</p>

<p>The redoubtable guerrilla, with fifty men, instantly sprang from
behind a wood-pile and fired a volley. Twenty-six bullets entered
the cabin of the retreating boat; but, thanks to the loyal women, no
person was killed or captured.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Droll Flag of Truce.</div>

<p>One day, a seedy individual in soiled gray walked into Halleck's
private room at the Planter's House, in St. Louis, and, with the
military salute, thus addressed him:</p>

<p>"Sir, I am an officer of General Price's army, and have brought you a
letter under flag of truce."</p>

<p>"Where's your flag of truce?" growled Halleck.</p>

<p>"Here," was the prompt reply, and the Rebel pulled a dirty white rag
from his pocket!</p>

<p>He had entered our lines, and come one hundred and fifty miles,
without detection, passing pickets, sentinels, guards, and
provost-marshals. Halleck, who plumed himself on his organizing
capacity and rigid police regulations, was not a little chagrined. He
sent back the unique messenger with a letter, assuring Price that he
would shoot as a spy any one repeating the attempt. </p>

<div class="sidenote">Rebel Guerrillas Outwitted.</div>

<p>In January, Colonel Lawson, of the Missouri Union forces, was
captured by a dozen Rebels, who, after some threats of hanging,
decided to release him upon parole. Not one of them could read or
write a line. Lawson, requested by them to make out his own parole,
drew up and signed an agreement, pledging himself never to take up
arms against the United States of America, or give aid and comfort to
its enemies! Upon this novel promise he was set at liberty.</p>

<p>On the 3d of February a journalistic friend telegraphed me from Cairo:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"You can't come too soon: take the first train."</p>
</div>

<p>Immediately obeying the summons, I found that Commodore Foote had
gone up the Tennessee River with the new gunboats. The accompanying
land forces were under the command of an Illinois general named
Grant, of whom the country knew only the following:</p>

<p>Making a reconnoissance to Belmont, Missouri, opposite Columbus,
Kentucky, he had ventured too far, when the enemy opened on him.
Yielding to the fighting temptation, he made a lively resistance,
until compelled to retreat, leaving behind his dead and wounded.
Jefferson Davis officially proclaimed it a great Confederate
success,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
and Rebel newspapers grew merry over Grant's bad generalship,
expressing the wish that he might long lead the Yankee armies!</p>

<div class="poem">
   <div class="stanza">
      &mdash;&mdash;"We, ignorant of ourselves,<br />
      Beg often for our own harms; so find we profit<br />
      By losing of our prayers."<br />
   </div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Expedition to Fort Henry.</div>

<p>As the gunboats had never been tested, intense interest was felt
in their success. Approaching Fort Henry, three went forward to
reconnoiter. At the distance of two miles and a half, a twenty-four
pounder rifled ball penetrated the state-room of Captain Porter,
commanding the Essex, passing under his table, and cutting off the
feet of a pair of stockings which hung against the ceiling as neatly
as shears would have cut them.</p>

<p>"Pretty good shot!" said Porter. "Now we will show them ours." And he
dropped a nine-inch Dahlgren shell right into the fort.</p>

<p>The next day, a large number of torpedoes, each containing
seventy-five pounds of powder, were fished up from the bottom of the
river. The imprudent tongue of an angry Rebel woman revealed their
whereabouts. Prophesying that the whole fleet would be blown to
atoms, she was compelled to divulge what she knew, or be confined in
the guard-house. In mortal terror she gave the desired information.
The torpedoes were found wet and harmless. Commodore Foote predicted</p>

<p>"I can take that fort in about an hour and a half."</p>

<p>The night was excessively rainy and severe upon our boys in blue in
their forest bivouacs; but in the well-furnished cabin of General
Grant's steamer, we found "going to war" an agreeable novelty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its Capture by Commodore Foote.</div>

<p>At mid-day on the 6th, Foote fired his first shot, at the distance
of seventeen hundred yards. Then he slowly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
approached the fort with his entire fleet, until within four hundred
yards. The Rebel fire was very severe; but he determined to vindicate
the iron-clads or to sink them in the Tennessee. The wood-work of
his flag-ship was riddled by thirty-one shots, but her iron plating
turned off the balls like hail. All the boats were more or less
damaged; but they fully established their usefulness, and their
officers and men behaved with the greatest gallantry. One poor fellow
on the Essex, terribly scalded by the bursting of a steam drum,
learning that the fort was captured, sprung from his bunk, ran up the
hatchway, and cheered until he fell senseless upon the deck. He died
the same night.</p>

<p>With several fellow-correspondents, I witnessed the fight from the
top of a high tree, up on the river-bank, between the fortification
and the gun-boats. There was little to be seen but smoke. Foote's
prediction proved correct. After he had fired about six hundred
shots, just one hour and fifteen minutes from the beginning, the
colors of Fort Henry were struck, and the gunboats trembled with the
cheers and huzzas of our men.</p>

<p>The Rebel infantry, numbering four thousand, escaped. Grant's
forces, detained by the mud, came up too late to surround them.
Brigadier-General Lloyd Tilghman, commanding, and the immediate
garrison, were captured.</p>

<p>In the barracks we found camp-fires blazing, dinners boiling, and
half-made biscuits still in the pans. Pistols, muskets, bowie-knives,
books, tables partially set for dinner, half-written letters,
playing-cards, blankets, and carpet-sacks were scattered about.</p>

<p>Our soldiers ransacked trunks, arrayed themselves in Rebel coats,
hats, and shirts, armed themselves with Rebel revolvers, stuffed
their pockets with Rebel books
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
and miniatures, and some were soon staggering under heavy loads of
Rebel whisky.</p>

<p>From the quarters of one officer, I abstracted a small Confederate
flag; the daguerreotype of a female face so regular and classic that,
without close inspection, it was difficult to believe it taken from
life; a long tress of brown hair, and a package of elegantly written
letters, full of a sister's affection. A year afterward I was able to
return these family mementoes to their owner in Jackson, Mississippi.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Delighted Negress.</div>

<p>Our shots had made great havoc. Carpet-sacks, trunks, and tables were
torn in pieces, walls and roofs were pierced with holes large enough
for a man to creep through, and cavities plowed in the ground which
would conceal a flour-barrel. A female Marius among the ruins, in the
form of an old negress, stood rubbing her hands with glee.</p>

<p>"You seem to have had hot work here, aunty."</p>

<p>"Lord, yes, mass'r, we did just dat! De big balls, dey come whizzing

<p>"Where are all your soldiers?"</p>

<p>"Lord A'mighty knows. Dey jus' runned away like turkeys&mdash;nebber fired

<p>"How many were there?"</p>

<p>"Dere was one Arkansas regiment over dere where you see de tents,
a Mississippi regiment dere, another dere, two Tennessee regiments
here, and lots more over de river."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you run with them?"</p>

<p>"I was sick, you see" (she could only speak in a whisper); "besides,
I wasn't afraid&mdash;only ob de shots. I just thought if dey didn't kill
me I was all right." </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where is General Tilghman?"</p>

<p>"You folks has got him&mdash;him and de whole garrison inside de fort."</p>

<p>"You don't seem to feel very badly about it."</p>

<p>"Not berry, mass'r!"&mdash;with a fresh rub of the hands and a grin all
over her sable face.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scenes in the Captured Fortress.</div>

<p>In the fort, the magazine was torn open, the guns completely
shattered, and the ground stained with blood, brains, and fragments
of flesh. Under gray blankets were six corpses, one with the head
torn off and the trunk completely blackened with powder; others with
legs severed and breasts opened in ghastly wounds. The survivors,
stretched upon cots, rent the air with groans.</p>

<p>The captured Rebel officers, in a profusion of gold lace, were
taken to Grant's head-quarters. Tilghman was good-looking,
broad-shouldered, with the pompous manner of the South. Commodore
Foote asked him:</p>

<p>"How could you fight against the old flag?"</p>

<p>"It was hard," he replied, "but I had to go with my people."</p>

<p>Presently a Chicago reporter inquired of him:</p>

<p>"How do you spell your name, General?"</p>

<p>"Sir," replied Tilghman, with indescribable pomposity, "if General
Grant wishes to use my name in his official dispatches, I have no
objection; but, sir, I do not wish to appear at all in this matter in
any newspaper report."</p>

<p>"I merely asked it," persisted the journalist, "for the list of
prisoners captured."</p>

<p>Tilghman, whose name should have been Turveydrop, replied, with a
lofty air and a majestic wave of the hand:</p>

<p>"You will oblige me, sir, by not giving my name in any newspaper
connection whatever!" </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the Rebel officers was reminded of the predominance of Union
sentiments among the people about Fort Henry.</p>

<p>"True, sir," was his reply. "It is always so in these hilly
countries. You see, these d-----d Hoosiers don't know any better.
For the genuine southern feeling, sir, you must go among the
gentlemen&mdash;the rich people. You won't find any Tories there."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Commodore Foote in the Pulpit.</div>

<p>The gunboats returned to Cairo for repairs. On the next Sunday
morning, the pastor of the Cairo Presbyterian Church failing to
arrive, Commodore Foote was induced to conduct the services. From the
text:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"Let not your hearts be troubled; ye believe in God;
   believe also in me,"</p>
</div>

<p>he preached an excellent practical discourse, urging that human
happiness depends upon integrity, pure living, and conscientious
performance of duty.</p>

<p>The land forces remained near Fort Henry. A few days after the
battle, I stepped into General Grant's head-quarters to bid him
good-by, as I was about starting for New York.</p>

<p>"You had better wait a day or two," he said.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I am going over to capture Fort Donelson to-morrow."</p>

<p>"How strong is it?"</p>

<p>"We have not been able to ascertain exactly, but I think we can take
it. At all events, we can try."</p>

<p>The hopelessly muddy roads and the falling snow were terrible to our
troops, who had no tents; but Grant marched to the fort. On Wednesday
he skirmished and placed his men in position; on Thursday, Friday,
and Saturday, he fought from daylight until dark. On Saturday
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
night, the sanguine General Pillow telegraphed to Nashville:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"The day is ours. I have repulsed the enemy at all points,
   but I want re-enforcements."</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Capture of Fort Donelson.</div>

<p>Before dawn on Sunday, the negro servant of a Confederate staff
officer escaped into our lines, and was taken to General Grant. He
insisted that the Rebel commanders were consulting about surrender,
and that Floyd's men were already deserting the fort. A few hours
later came a letter from Buckner, suggesting the appointment of
commissioners to adjust terms of capitulation. Grant wrote in
answer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"I have no terms but unconditional surrender. I propose to
   move immediately upon your works."</p>
</div>

<p>Buckner's response, exquisitely characteristic of the Rebels,
regretfully accepted what he described as Grant's "ungenerous and
unchivalrous terms!" So the North was electrified by a success which
recalled the great battles of Napoleon.</p>

<p>Grant first invested the garrison with thirteen thousand men. The
enemy's force was twenty-two thousand. For two days, Grant's little
command laid siege to this much larger army, which was protected by
ample fortifications. At the end of the second day, Grant received
re-enforcements, swelling his forces to twenty-six thousand.</p>

<p>From three to four thousand Rebels, of Floyd's command, escaped from
the fort; others escaped on the way to Cairo, and several thousand
were killed or wounded; but Grant delivered, at Cairo, upward of
fifteen thousand eight hundred prisoners.</p>

<p>I was in Chicago when these captives, on their way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
to Camp Douglas, passed through the streets in sad procession. Motley
was the only wear. A few privates had a stripe on the pantaloons and
wore gray military caps; but most, in slouched hats and garments
of gray or butternut, made no attempt at uniform. Some had the
long hair and cadaverous faces of the extreme South; but under
the broad-brimmed hats of the majority, appeared the full, coarse
features of the working classes of Missouri, Tennessee, and Arkansas.
The Chicago citizens, who crowded the streets, were guilty of no
taunts or rude words toward the prisoners.</p>

<p>Columbus, Kentucky, twenty miles below Cairo, on the highest bluffs
of the Mississippi, was called the Gibraltar of the West, and
expected to be the scene of a great battle.</p>

<p>On the 4th of March, a naval and land expedition was ready to attack
it. Before leaving Cairo, hundreds of workmen crowded the gunboats,
repairing damages received on the Tennessee River&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"With busy hammers closing rivets up, And giving dreadful
   notes of preparation."</p>
</div>

<p>Commodore Foote, lame from his Donelson wound, hobbled on board upon
crutches. A great National flag was taken along.</p>

<p>"Don't forget that," said the commodore. "Fight or no fight, we must
raise it over Columbus!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Army and Navy Officers Contrasted.</div>

<p>The leading commanders of the flotilla were from the regular
navy&mdash;quiet and unassuming, with no nonsense about them. They were
far freer from envy and jealousy than army officers. Before the war,
the latter had been stationed for years at frontier posts, hundreds
of miles beyond civilization, with no resources except
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
drinking and gambling, nothing to excite National feeling or prick
the bubble of their State pride. Naval officers, going all over
the world, had acquired the liberality which only travel imparts,
and learned that, abroad, their country was not known as Virginia
or Mississippi, but the <em>United</em> States of America. With them, it
was the Nation first, and the State afterward. Hence, while nearly
all southerners holding commissions in the regular army joined the
Rebellion, the navy almost unanimously remained loyal.</p>

<p>The low, flat, black iron-clads crept down the river like enormous
turtles. Each had attending it a little pocket edition of a
steamboat, in the shape of a tug, capable of carrying fifty or sixty
men, and moving up the strong current twelve miles an hour. They were
constantly puffing about among the unwieldy vessels like a breathless
little errand-boy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The "Gibraltar of the West."</div>

<p>Nearing Columbus, we found that the Rebels had evacuated it twelve
hours before. The town was already held by an enterprising scouting
party of the Second Illinois Cavalry, who had unearthed and raised an
old National flag. Our colors waved from the Rebel Gibraltar, and the
last Confederate soldier had abandoned Kentucky.</p>

<p>The enemy left in hot haste. Half-burned barracks, chairs, beds,
tables, cooking-stoves, letters, charred gun-carriages, bent
musket-barrels, bayonets, and provisions were promiscuously lying
about.</p>

<p>The main fortifications, on a plateau one hundred and fifty feet
high, mounted eighty-three guns, commanding the river for nearly
three miles. Here, and in the auxiliary works, we captured one
hundred and fifty pieces of artillery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scenes in Columbus, Kentucky.</div>

<p>Fastened to the bluff, we found one end of a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
chain cable, composed of seven-eighths inch iron, which the brilliant
Gideon J. Pillow had stretched across the river, to prevent the
passage of our gunboats! It was worthy of the man who, in Mexico,
dug his ditch on the wrong side of the parapet. The momentum of an
iron-clad would have snapped it like a pipe-stem, had not the current
of the river broken it long before.</p>

<p>We found, also, enormous piles of torpedoes, which the Rebels had
declared would annihilate the Yankee fleet. They became a standing
jest among our officers, who termed them original members of the
Peace Society, and averred that the rates of marine insurance
immediately declined whenever the companies learned that torpedoes
had been planted in the waters where the boats were to run!</p>

<p>In the abandoned post-office I collected a bushel of Rebel
newspapers, dating back for several weeks. At first the Memphis
journals extravagantly commended the South Carolina planters for
burning their cotton, after the capture of Port Royal, and urged
universal imitation of their example. They said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"Let the whole South be made a Moscow; let our enemies find
   nothing but blackened ruins to reward their invasion!"</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Extracts from Rebel Newspapers.</div>

<p>But when the capture of Donelson rendered the early fall of Memphis
probable, the same journals suddenly changed their tone. They
argued that Moscow was not a parallel case; that it would be highly
injudicious to fire their city, as the Yankees, if they did take it,
would hold it only for a short time; that those who urged applying
the torch should be punished as demagogues and public enemies!
But they abounded in frantic appeals like the following from <cite>The
Avalanche</cite>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"For the sake of honor and manhood, we trust no young
   unmarried
   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
   man will suffer himself to be drafted. He would become a by-word,
   a scoff, a burning shame to his sex and his State. If young men in
   pantaloons will sit behind desks, counters, and molasses-barrels, let
   the girls present them with the garment proper to their peaceable
   spirits. He that would go to the field, but cannot, should be
   aided to do so; he that can go, but will not, should be made to do
   so."</p>
</div>

<p><cite>The Avalanche</cite> was a great advocate of what is termed the
"aggressive policy," declaring that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"The victorious armies of the South should be precipitated
   upon the North. <del>IIer</del><ins>Her</ins> chief cities should
   be seized or reduced to ashes; her armies scattered, her States
   subjugated, and her people compelled to defray the expenses of a
   war which they have wickedly commenced and obstinately continued.
   *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Fearless and invincible, a race of warriors rivaling
   any that ever followed the standard of an Alexander, a C&aelig;sar,
   or a Napoleon, the southerners have the power and the will to carry
   this war into the enemy's country. Let, then, the lightnings of a
   nation's wrath scathe our foul oppressors! Let the thunder-bolts of
   war be hurled back upon our dastardly invaders, from the Atlantic to
   the Pacific, until the recognition of southern independence shall be
   extorted from the reluctant North, and terms of peace be dictated by
   a victorious southern army at New York or Chicago."</p>

<p>Our hospitals at Mound City, Illinois, contained fourteen hundred
inmates. A walk along the double rows of cots in the long wards
revealed the sadder phase of war. Here was a typhoid-fever patient,
motionless and unconscious, the light forever gone out from his
glazed eyes; here a lad, pale and attenuated, who, with a shattered
leg, had lain upon this weary couch for four months. There was a
Tennessean, who, abandoning his family, came stealthily hundreds
of miles to enlist under the Stars and Stripes, with perfect faith
in their triumph, and had lost a leg at Donelson; an Illinoisan,
from the same battle, with a ghastly aperture in the face, still
blackened with powder from his enemy's rifle; a young officer in neat
dressing-gown, furnished by the United States Sanitary Commission,
sitting up reading a newspaper, but with the sleeve of his left arm
limp and empty; marines terribly scalded by the bursting boiler
of the Essex at Fort Henry, some of whose whole bodies were one
continuous scar. Sick, wounded, and convalescent were alike cheerful;
and twenty-five Sisters of Mercy, worthy of their name, moved
noiselessly among them, ministering to their wants. </p>

<div class="sidenote">Starting down the Mississippi.</div>

<p>On the 14th of March, the flotilla again started down the
Mississippi, steaming slowly by Columbus, where Venus followed
close upon Mars, in the form of two women disbursing pies and some
other commodities to sailors and soldiers. The next day we anchored
above Island Number Ten, where Beauregard had built formidable
fortifications.</p>

<p>A fast little Rebel gunboat, called the Grampus, ran screeching away
from the range of our guns. Below her we could read with glasses the
names painted upon the many steamers lying in front of the enemy's
works, and see the guns upon a great floating battery.</p>

<p>Our gunboats fired one or two experimental shots, and the
mortar-rafts, with tremendous explosions, began to throw their
ten-inch shells, weighing two hundred and fifty pounds each. Great
results were expected from these enormous mortars, but they proved
inaccurate. Our shots fell among the batteries and steamboats of the
enemy, throwing up clouds of dirt and sheets of water. The Rebel guns
replied with great puffs of smoke; but their missiles, bounding along
the river, fell three-quarters of a mile short.</p>

<p>Light skirmishing in closer range continued for several days. My own
quarters were on the Benton, Commodore Foote's flagship. She was the
largest of the iron-clads,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
one hundred and eighty-three feet by seventy, and contained quite a
little community of two hundred and forty men.</p>

<p>Standing upon the hurricane roof, directly over our bow-guns, we
caught the first glimpse of each shot, a few feet from the muzzle,
and watched it rushing through the air like a round, black meteor,
till it exploded two or three miles away. After we saw the warning
puff of smoke, the time seemed very long before each Rebel shot
struck the water near us; but no more than ten or fifteen seconds
ever elapsed.</p>

<p>When ready to attack the batteries, Commodore Foote said to me:</p>

<p>"You had better take your place with the other correspondents, upon a
transport in the rear, out of range. Should any accident befall you
here, censure would be cast upon me for permitting you to stay."</p>

<p>Haunted by a resistless curiosity to learn exactly how one feels
under fire, I persuaded him to let me remain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bombardment of Island Number Ten.</div>

<p>Two other iron-clads, the St. Louis and the Cincinnati, were lashed
upon either side of the Benton. Hammocks were taken down and piled
in front of the boilers to protect them; the hose was attached to
reservoirs of hot water, designed for boarders in close conflict;
surgeons scrutinized the edges of their instruments, while our triple
floating battery moved slowly down, with the other iron-clads a short
distance in the rear. We opened fire, and the balls of the enemy soon
replied, now and then striking our boats.</p>

<p>A deafening noise from the St. Louis shook every plank beneath our
feet. A moment after, a dozen men rushed upon her deck, their faces
so blackened by powder that they would have been taken for negroes.
Two were carrying the lifeless form of a third; several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
others were wounded. Through the din of the cannonade, one of her
crew shouted to us from a port-hole that an old forty-two pounder had
exploded, killing and mutilating several men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"Here comes another Shot."</div>

<p>We obtained the best view from the hurricane deck of the Benton,
where there could be no special danger from splinters. While we stood
there, one of the party was constantly on the look-out, and, seeing a
puff of smoke curl up from the Rebel battery, he would shout:</p>

<p>"Here comes another!"</p>

<p>Then we all dropped upon our faces behind the iron-plated
pilot-house, which rose from the deck like a great umbrella. The
screaming shot would sometimes strike our bows, but usually pass
over, falling into the water behind us.</p>

<p>While the Rebels fired from one battery, there was just sufficient
excitement to make it interesting; but when they opened with two
others, stationed at different points in the bend of the river,
their range completely covered the pilot-house. Dropping behind that
shelter to avoid the missiles in front, we were exposed to a hail of
shot from the side. Thereupon the commodore peremptorily ordered us
below, and we went down upon the gun-deck.</p>

<p>A correspondent of <cite>The Chicago Times</cite>, who chanced
to be on board, took a position in the stern of the boat, under the
impression that it was entirely safe. A moment after he came rushing
in with blanched face and dripping clothing. A shot had struck within
three feet of him, glancing into the river, and drenching every thing
in the vicinity.</p>

<p>That long gun-deck was alive with action. The executive officer,
Lieutenant Bishop, a gallant young fellow,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
fresh from the naval school, superintended every thing. Swarthy
gunners manned the pieces; little powder-boys rushed to and fro with
ammunition, and hurrying men crowded the long compartment.</p>

<p>There came a tremendous crashing of glass, iron, and wood! An
eight-inch solid shot, penetrating the half-inch iron plating and
the five-inch timber, near the bows, as if they were paper, buried
itself in the deck, and rebounded, striking the roof. In that manner
it danced along the entire length of the boat, through the cabin, the
ward-room, the machinery, the pantry&mdash;where it smashed a great deal
of crockery&mdash;until, at the extreme stern, it fell and remained upon
the commodore's writing-desk, crushing in the lid.</p>

<p>A moment before the noisy, agile visitor arrived, the whole deck
seemed crowded with busy men. A moment after, I looked again. A score
of undismayed fellows were comfortably blowing splinters from their
mouths and beards, and brushing them from their hair and faces; but,
by a fortunate accident, not a single one of them was hurt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How One <del>feels under</del><ins>Feels Under</ins> Fire.</div>

<p>As the shot screamed along very near me, my curiosity diminished. I
had a dim perception that nothing in this gunboat life could become
me like the leaving of it. A mulatto cabin-boy, whose face turned
almost white when the missile tore through the boat, shared my
sensations.</p>

<p>"I wish that I was out of it," he said, confidentially; "but I put my
own neck into this yoke, and I have got to wear it."</p>

<p>Toward evening, some of the enemy's batteries were silent, and we
idlers once more sought the hurricane deck, dodging behind the
pilot-house whenever the smoke puffed from the hostile guns. Once,
some one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
cried, "There she comes!" and we dropped as usual. Looking up, I
noticed a second engineer standing beside me.</p>

<p>"Lie down, Blakely!" I said, sharply.</p>

<p>He replied laughingly, with his hands in his pockets:</p>

<p>"O no, there is no need of it; one is just as safe here."</p>

<p>While he spoke, the Rebel shot passed within fifteen inches of his
bloodless face, shaved a sheet-iron ventilator, tore through the
chimney, severed a large wrought-iron rod, struck the deck, plowed
through a half-inch iron plate, neatly cutting it in two, passed
under the next plate, and then came out again, with its force spent,
and rolled languidly against a sky-light. When he felt the rush of
air, Blakely bent back almost double, and thereafter he was among the
first to seek the shelter of the pilot-house.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fifty Shots to the Minute.</div>

<p>From the mortars and the guns on both sides, there were sometimes
fifty shots to the minute. The jarrings and explosions induced
head-ache for hours afterward. The results of the day's bombardment
were not very sanguinary. Our iron-clads were struck scores of times,
but few men were injured. This desultory fighting was kept up for two
or three weeks.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, General Pope, moving across the country from Cairo with
great enterprise and activity, had defeated the Rebels and captured
their forts at New Madrid, on the Missouri shore of the Mississippi,
eight miles below Island Number Ten. He thus held the river in the
rear of the enemy, preventing steamboats from ascending to them; but
he had not even a skiff or a raft in which he could cross to the
Tennessee bank, and reach the rear of the fortifications. How to
supply him with boats was the great problem.</p>

<p>Pope was anxious that the commodore should send
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
one of the iron-clads to him, past the Rebel fortifications. Foote
hesitated, as running batteries was then an untried experiment.</p>

<p>Pope had an active, hard-working Illinois engineer regiment, which
began cutting a canal, to open communication between the flotilla and
New Madrid; and we waited for results.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Daily Life on a Gunboat.</div>

<p>I found life on the Benton full of novelty. More than half of
her crew were old salts, and the discipline was the same as on a
man-of-war. Half-hour bells marked the passage of time. Every morning
the deck was holystoned to its utmost possibilities of whiteness.
Through each day we heard the shrill whistle of the boatswain, amid
hoarse calls of "All hands to quarters," "Stand by the hammocks!" etc.</p>

<p>Even the negro servants caught the naval expressions. One of them,
playing on the guitar and singing, broke down from too high a pitch.</p>

<p>"Too much elevation there," said he. "I must depress a little."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied another. "Start again on the gun-deck."</p>

<p>Exchanging shots with the enemy grew monotonous. Reading, writing, or
playing chess in the ward-room, we carelessly noted the reports from
the Rebel batteries, and some officer from the deck walked in, saying:</p>

<p>"There's another!"</p>

<p>"Where did it strike?" asked some one, quite
<del>care lessly</del><ins>carelessly</ins>.</p>

<p>"Near us," or "Just over us in the woods," would be the reply; and
the idlers returned to their employments.</p>

<p>My own state-room was within six feet of a thirty-two pounder, which
fired every fifteen minutes during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
the day. The explosions in no wise disturbed my afternoon naps.</p>

<p>On Sunday mornings, after the weekly muster, the men in clean blue
shirts and tidy clothing, and the officers, in full uniform, with
all their bravery of blue and gold, assembled on the gun-deck for
religious service. Hat in hand, they stood in a half circle around
the commodore, who, behind a high stool, upon which the National flag
was spread, read the comprehensive prayer for "All who are afflicted
in mind, body, or estate," or acknowledged that "We have done the
things which we ought not to have done, and left undone the things
which we ought to have done."</p>

<p>Among the groups of worshipers were seen the gaping mouths of the
black guns, and the pyramidal piles of grape and canister ready for
use. During prayer, the boat was often shaken by the discharge of
a mortar, which made the neighboring woods resound with its long,
rolling echoes. The commodore extemporized a brief, simple address on
Christian life and duty; then the men were "piped down" and dispersed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Carondelet Runs the Batteries.</div>

<p>On a dark April night, during a terrific thunder-shower, the
iron-clad Carondelet started to run the gantlet. The undertaking was
deemed hazardous in the extreme. The commodore gave to her commander
written instructions how to destroy her, should she become disabled;
and solemnly commended him to the mercy and protection of Almighty
God.</p>

<p>The Carondelet crept noiselessly down through the darkness. When the
Rebels discovered her, they opened with shot, shell, and bullets.
All her ports were closed, and she did not fire a gun. It was too
dark to guide her by the insufficient glimpses of the shore obtained
from the little peep-holes of her pilot-house. Mr. D. R. Hoell, an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
old river pilot, volunteered to remain unprotected on the open upper
deck, among the rattling shots and the singing bullets, to give
information to his partners within. His daring was promptly rewarded
by an appointment as lieutenant in the navy.</p>

<p>Upon the flag-ship above intense anxiety prevailed. After an hour,
which seemed a day, from far down the river boomed two heavy reports;
then there was silence, then two shots again. All gave a sigh of
relief. This was the signal that the Carondelet had lived through the
terrible ordeal!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wonderful Feat of Pope's Engineers.</div>

<p>The Rebels had made themselves very merry over Pope's canal. But,
at daylight on the second morning after this feat of the iron-clad,
they saw four little stern-wheel steamboats lying in front of Pope's
camps. The canal was a success! In two weeks the indefatigable
engineers had brought these steamers from Foote's flotilla, sixteen
miles, through corn-fields, woods, and swamps, cutting channels from
one bayou to another, and felling heavy timber all the way. They were
compelled to saw off hundreds of huge trees, three feet below the
water's edge. It was one of the most creditable feats of the war.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"Let all the world take notice," said a Confederate newspaper,
   "that the southern troops are gentlemen, and must be subjected to no
   drudgery."</p>
</div>

<p>The loyal troops, like these Illinois engineers, were men of skilled
industry, proud to know themselves "kings of two hands."</p>

<p>The Confederates felt that Birnam wood had come to Dunsinane.
Declaring that it was useless to fight men who would deliberately
float gunboats by the very muzzles of their heavy guns, and could run
steamers sixteen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
miles over dry land, they began to evacuate Island Number Ten. But
Pope had already ferried the greater part of his army across the
river, and he replied to my inquiries:</p>

<p>"I will have every mother's son of them!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Rebels Effectively Caged.</div>

<p>He kept his promise. The Rebels were caged. They fled in haste across
the country to Tiptonville, where they supposed their steamboats
awaited them. Instead, they found two of our iron-clads lying in
front of the town, and learned that Pope held the river even ten
miles below. The trap was complete. On their front was Tiptonville,
with the cavernous eyes of the Carondelet and the Pittsburgh
ominously scrutinizing them. At their left was an impassable line of
lake and slough; at their right a dry region, bounded by the river,
and held by our troops; in their rear, Pope's army was hotly pursuing
them. Some leaped into the lake or plunged into the swamps, trying to
escape. Three times the Rebel forces drew up in line of battle; but
they were too much demoralized to fight, and, after a weary night,
they surrendered unconditionally.</p>

<p>At sunrise, long files of stained, bedraggled soldiers, in butternut
and jeans, began to move sadly into a great corn-field, and stack
their arms. The prisoners numbered twenty-eight hundred. We captured
upward of a hundred heavy guns, twenty-five field-pieces, half a
dozen steamboats, and immense supplies of provisions and ammunition.
The victory was won with trifling loss of life, and reflected the
highest credit both upon the land and water forces. The army and the
navy, fitting together like the two blades of the scissors, had cut
the gordian knot.</p>

<p>Pope telegraphed to Halleck that, if steamboats could be furnished
him, in four days he would plant the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
Stars and Stripes in Memphis. Halleck, as usual, engrossed in
strategy, declined to supply the transportation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Battle of Shiloh.</div>

<p>Simultaneously with the capture of Island Number Ten occurred the
battle of Shiloh. The first reports were very wild, stating our
loss at seventeen thousand, and asserting that the Union commander
had been disastrously surprised, and hundreds of men bayoneted in
their tents. It was even added that Grant was intoxicated during the
action. This last fiction showed the tenacity of a bad name. Years
before, Grant was intemperate; but he had abandoned the habit soon
after the beginning of the war.</p>

<p>General Albert Sydney Johnson was killed, and Beauregard ultimately
driven back, leaving his dead and wounded in our hands; but Jefferson
Davis, with the usual Rebel policy, announced in a special message to
the Confederate Congress:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"It has pleased Almighty God again to crown the Confederate
   arms with a glorious and decided victory over our invaders."</p>
</div>

<p>I went up the Tennessee River by a boat crowded with
representatives&mdash;chiefly women&mdash;of the Sanitary Commissions of
Cincinnati, St. Louis, and Chicago.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Reverend Robert Colyer.</div>

<p>One evening, religious services were held in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
cabin. A clergyman exhorted his hearers, when they should arrive at
the bloody field, to minister to the spiritual as well as physical
wants of the sufferers. With special infelicity, he added:</p>

<p>"Many of them have doubtless been wicked men; but you can, at least,
remind them of divine mercy, and tell them the story of the thief on
the cross."</p>

<p>The next speaker, a quiet gentleman, wearing the blouse of a private
soldier, after some remarks about practical religion, added:</p>

<p>"I can not agree with the last brother. I believe we shall best serve
the souls of our wounded soldiers by ministering, for the present,
simply to their bodies. For my own part, I feel that he who has
fallen fighting for our country&mdash;for your Cause and mine&mdash;is more of
a man than I am. He may have been wicked; but I think room will be
found for him among the many mansions above. I should be ashamed to
tell him the story of the thief on the cross."</p>

<p>Hearty, spontaneous clapping of hands through the crowded cabin
followed this sentiment&mdash;a rather unusual demonstration for a
prayer-meeting. The speaker was the Rev. Robert Colyer, of Chicago.</p>

<p>With officers who had participated in the battle, I visited every
part of the field. The ground was broken by sharp hills, deep
ravines, and dense timber, which the eye could not penetrate.</p>

<p>The reports of a surprise were substantially untrue. No man was
bayoneted in his tent, or anywhere else, according to the best
evidence I could obtain.</p>

<p>But the statements, said to come from Grant and Sherman, that they
could not have been better prepared, had they known that Beauregard
designed to attack, were also untrue. Our troops were not encamped
advantageously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
for battle. Raw and unarmed regiments were on the extreme front,
which was not picketed or scouted as it should have been in the face
of an enemy.</p>

<p>Beauregard attacked on Sunday morning at daylight. The Rebels greatly
outnumbered the Unionists, and impetuously forced them back. Grant's
army was entirely western. It contained representatives of nearly
every county in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Partially unprepared, and steadily driven back, often ill commanded
and their organizations broken, the men fought with wonderful
tenacity. It was almost a hand-to-hand conflict. Confederates and
Loyalists, from behind trees, within thirty feet of each other, kept
up a hot fire, shouting respectively, "Bull Run!" and "Donelson!"</p>

<p>Prentiss' shattered division, in that dense forest, was flanked
before its commander knew that the supporting forces&mdash;McClernand on
his right and Hurlbut on his left&mdash;had been driven back. Messengers
sent to him by those commanders were killed. During a lull in the
firing, Prentiss was lighting his cigar from the pipe of a soldier
when he learned that the enemy was on both sides of him, half a mile
in his rear. With the remnant of his command he was captured.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Union Orator Captured.</div>

<p>Remaining in Rebel hands for six months, he was enabled to indulge
in oratory to his heart's content. Southern papers announced, with
intense indignation, that Prentiss&mdash;occupying, with his officers, an
entire train&mdash;called out by the bystanders, was permitted to make
radical Union speeches at many southern railway stations. Removed
from prison to prison, the Illinois General continued to harangue the
people, and his men to sing the "Star-Spangled Banner," until at last
the Rebels were glad to exchange them. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Grant and Sherman in Battle.</div>

<p>Throughout the battle, Grant rode to and fro on the front, smoking
his inevitable cigar, with his usual stolidity and good fortune.
Horses and men were killed all around him, but he did not receive
a scratch. On that wooded field, it was impossible for any one to
keep advised of the progress of the struggle. Grant gave few orders,
merely bidding his generals do the best they could.</p>

<p>Sherman had many hair-breadth 'scapes. His
<del>briddle</del><ins>bridle</ins>-rein was cut off by a bullet
within two inches of his fingers. As he was leaning forward in the
saddle, a ball whistled through the top and back of his hat. His
metallic shoulder-strap warded off another bullet, and a third passed
through the palm of his hand. Three horses were shot under him.
He was the hero of the day. All awarded to him the highest praise
for skill and gallantry. He was promoted to a major-generalship,
dating from the battle. His official report was a clear, vivid, and
fascinating description of the conflict.</p>

<p>Five bullets penetrated the clothing of an officer on McClernand's
staff, but did not break the skin. A ball knocked out two front teeth
of a private in the Seventeenth Illinois Infantry, but did him no
further injury. A rifle-shot passed through the head of a soldier in
the First Missouri Artillery, coming out just above the ear, but did
not prove fatal. Dr. Cornyn, of St. Louis, told me that he extracted
a ball from the brain of one soldier, who, three days afterward, was
on duty, with the bullet in his pocket.</p>

<p>More than a year afterward, at the battle of Fredericksburg, Captain
Richard Cross, of the Fifth New Hampshire Infantry, noticed one of
his men whose skull had been cut open by the fragment of a shell,
with a section of it standing upright, leaving the brain exposed.
Cross shut the piece of skull down like the lid of a teapot,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
tied a handkerchief around it, and sent to the rear the wounded
soldier, who ultimately recovered. The one truth, taught by field
experience to army surgeons, was that few, if any, wounds are
invariably fatal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Gallant Feat by Sweeney.</div>

<p>At Shiloh, Brigadier-General Thomas W. Sweeney, who had lost one arm
in the Mexican War, received a Mini&eacute; bullet in his remaining arm, and
another shot in his foot, while his horse fell riddled with seven
balls. Almost fainting from loss of blood, he was lifted upon another
horse, and remained on the field through the entire day. His coolness
and his marvelous escapes were talked of before many camp-fires
throughout the army.</p>

<p>Once, during the battle, he was unable to determine whether a battery
whose men were dressed in blue, was Rebel or Union. Sweeney, leaving
his command, rode at a gentle gallop directly toward the battery
until within pistol-shot, saw that it was manned by Confederates,
turned in a half circle, and rode back again at the same easy pace.
Not a single shot was fired at him, so much was the respect of the
Confederates excited by this daring act. I afterward met one of them,
who described with great vividness the impression which Sweeney's
gallantry made upon them.</p>

<p>The steady determination of Grant's troops during that long April
Sunday, was perhaps unequaled during the war. At night companies
were commanded by sergeants, regiments by lieutenants, and brigades
by majors. In several regiments, one-half the men were killed and
wounded; and in some entire divisions the killed and wounded exceeded
thirty-three per cent, of the numbers who went into battle.</p>

<p>I have seen no other field which gave indication of such deadly
conflict as the Shiloh ridges and ravines,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
everywhere covered with a very thick growth of timber&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"Shot-sown and bladed thick with steel."</p>
</div>

<p>In one tree I counted sixty bullet-holes; another bore marks of
more than ninety balls within ten feet of the ground. Sometimes, for
several yards in the dense <del>shubbery</del><ins>shrubbery</ins>,
it was difficult to find a twig as large as one's finger, which had
not been cut off by balls.</p>

<p>A friend of mine counted one hundred and twenty-six dead Rebels,
lying where they fell, upon an area less than fifty yards wide and
a quarter of a mile long. One of our details buried in a single
trench one hundred and forty-seven of the enemy, including three
lieutenant-colonels and four majors.</p>

<p>But our forces, overpowered by numbers, fell farther and further
back, while the Rebels took possession of many Union camps. At
night, our line, originally three miles in length, was shortened to
three-quarters of a mile.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Buell's Opportune Arrival.</div>

<p>For weeks the inscrutable Buell had been leisurely marching through
Kentucky and Tennessee, to join Grant. He arrived at the supreme
moment. At four o'clock on that Sunday afternoon, General Nelson, of
Kentucky, who commanded Buell's advance, crossed the Tennessee, and
rode up to Grant and his staff when the battle was raging.</p>

<p>"Here we are, General," said Nelson, with the military salute,
and pointing to long files of his well-clad, athletic, admirably
disciplined fellows, already pouring on the steamboats, to be ferried
across the river. "Here we are! We are not very military in our
division. We don't know many fine points or nice evolutions; but if
you want stupidity and hard fighting, I reckon we are the men for
you." </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>That night both armies lay upon their guns, and the opposing pickets
were often within a hundred yards of each other. The groans and cries
of the dying rendered it impossible to sleep. Grant said:</p>

<p>"We must not give the enemy the moral advantage of attacking
to-morrow morning. We must fire the first gun."</p>

<p>Just at day-break, the Rebels were surprised at all points of the
line by assaults from the foe whom they had supposed vanquished.
Grant's shattered troops behaved admirably, and Buell's splendid
army won new laurels. The Confederates were forced back at all
points. Their retreat was a stampede, leaving behind great quantities
of ammunition, commissary stores, guns, caissons, small arms,
supply-wagons and ambulances. They were not vigorously followed; but
as no effective pursuit was made by either side during the entire war
(until Sheridan, in one of its closing scenes, captured Lee), perhaps
northern and southern troops were too equally matched for either to
be thoroughly routed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beauregard Finally Routed.</div>

<p>Beauregard withdrew to Corinth, as usual, announcing a glorious
victory. He addressed a letter to Grant, asking permission, under
flag of truce, to send a party to the battle-field to bury the
Confederate dead. He prefaced the request as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"Sir, at the close of the conflict of yesterday, my forces
   being exhausted by the extraordinary length of the time
   during which they were engaged with yours on that and the
   preceding day, and it being apparent that you had received
   and were still receiving re-enforcements, I felt it my
   duty to withdraw my troops from the immediate scene of the
   conflict."</p>
</div>

<p>Grant was strongly tempted to assure Beauregard that no apologies for
his retreat were necessary! But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
he merely replied in a courteous note, declining the request, and
stating that the dead were already interred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Losses on Both Sides.</div>

<p>The losses on both sides were officially reported as follows:</p>

<table summary="battle loses">
   <tr><td></td><th>Killed.</th><th>Wounded.</th><th>Missing.</th><th>Total.</th></tr>
   <tr><td>Union</td><td>1,614</td><td>7,721</td><td>3,963</td><td>13,298</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Rebel</td><td>1,728</td><td>8,012</td><td>959</td><td>10,699</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The excess of Rebel wounded was owing to the superiority of the
muskets used by the Federal soldiers; and the excess of Union
missing, to the capture of Prentiss' division. </p>

<p>It was long after the battle of Shiloh before all the dead were

who was engaged in this revolting labor, told me that, after three or
four days, he found himself counting off the bodies as indifferently
as he would have measured cord-wood.</p>

of Grant, Buell, and Pope. It was a grand army.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grant Under a Cloud.</div>

<p>Grant nominally remained at the head of his corps, but was deprived
of power. He was under a cloud. Most injurious reports concerning his
conduct at Shiloh pervaded the country. All the leading journals were
represented in Halleck's army. At the daily accidental gatherings
of eight or ten correspondents, Grant was the subject of angry
discussion. The journalistic profession tends to make men oracular
and severely critical.</p>

<p>Several of these writers could demonstrate conclusively that Grant
was without capacity, but a favorite of Fortune; that his great
Donelson victory was achieved in spite of military blunders which
ought to have defeated him.</p>

cared nothing for the newspapers, was foolishly sensitive to every
word of criticism. But Grant, whom they really wounded, appeared
no more disturbed by these paper bullets of the brain than by the
leaden missiles of the enemy. He silently smoked and waited. The
only protest I ever knew him to utter was to the correspondent of a
journal which had denounced him with great severity:</p>

<p>"Your paper is very unjust to me; but time will make it all right. I
want to be judged only by my acts."</p>

<p>When the army began to creep forward, I messed at Grant's
head-quarters, with his chief of staff; and around the evening
camp-fires I saw much of the general. He rarely uttered a word upon
the political bearings of the war; indeed, he said little upon any
subject. With his eternal cigar, and his head thrown slightly to one
side, for hours he would sit silently before the fire, or walk back
and forth, with eyes upon the ground, or look on at our whist-table,
now and then making a suggestion about the play.</p>

<p>Most of his pictures greatly idealize his full, rather heavy face.
The journalists called him stupid. One of my <span lang="fr">confr&egrave;res</span> used to say:</p>

<p>"How profoundly surprised Mrs. Grant must have been, when she woke up
and learned that her husband was a great man!"</p>

<p>He impressed me as possessing great purity, integrity, and
amiability, with excellent judgment and boundless pluck. But I should
never have suspected him of military genius. Indeed, nearly every man
of whom, at the beginning of the war, I prophesied a great career,
proved inefficient, and <span lang="la">vice vers&acirc;</span>. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Jealousies of Military Men.</div>

<p>Military men seem to cherish more jealousies than members of any
other profession, except physicians and <span lang="fr">artistes</span>. At almost every
general head-quarters, one heard denunciations of rival commanders.
Grant was above this "mischievous foul sin of chiding." I never
heard him speak unkindly of a brother officer. Still, the soldier's
taint had slightly poisoned him. He regarded Rosecrans with peculiar
antipathy, and finally accepted the command of our combined armies
only on condition that he should be at once removed.</p>

<p>Hooker once boasted that he had the best army on the planet. One
would have declared that Grant commanded the worst. There was little
of that order, perfect drill, or pride, pomp, and circumstance, seen
among Buell's troops and in the Army of the Potomac. But Grant's
rough, rugged soldiers would fight wonderfully, and were not easily
demoralized. If their line became broken, every man, from behind a
tree, rock, or stump, blazed away at the enemy on his own account.
They did not throw up their hats at sight of their general, but were
wont to remark, with a grim smile:</p>

<p>"There goes the old man. He doesn't say much; but he's a pretty hard
nut for Johnny Reb. to crack."</p>

<p>Unlike Halleck, Grant did not pretend to familiarity with the details
of military text-books. He could not move an army with that beautiful
symmetry which McClellan displayed; but his pontoons were always up,
and his ammunition trains were never missing.</p>

<p>Though not occupied with details, he must have given them close
attention; for, while other commanding generals had forty or fifty
staff-officers, brilliant with braid and buttons, Grant allowed
himself but six or seven.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Union and Rebel Wounded.</div>

<p>Within ten days after the battle of Shiloh, nineteen large steamers,
crowded with wounded, passed down the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
river. In the long rows of cots which filled their cabins and crowded
their guards, Rebel and Union soldiers were lying side by side, and
receiving the same attendance.</p>

<p>Scores of volunteer physicians aided the regular army surgeons.
Hundreds of volunteer nurses, many of them wives, sisters, and
mothers, came from every walk of life to join in the work of mercy.
Hands hardened with toil, and hands that leisure and luxury left
white and soft, were bathing fevered brows, supporting wearied heads,
washing repulsive wounds, combing matted and bloody locks.</p>

<p>Patient forms kept nightly vigils beside the couches; gentle tones
dropped priceless words of sympathy; and, when all was over, tender
hands closed the fixed eyes, and smoothed the hair upon the white
foreheads. Thousands of poor fellows carried to their homes, both
North and South, grateful memories of those heroic women; thousands
of hearts, wrung with the tidings that loved ones were gone, found
comfort in the knowledge that their last hours were soothed by those
self-denying and blessed ministrations.</p>

<p>One man, who had received several bullets, lay undiscovered for eight
days in a little thicket, with no nourishment except rain-water.
After discovery he lived nearly two weeks. At some points the ground
was so closely covered with mutilated bodies that it was difficult to
step between them. One soldier, rigid in death, was found lying upon
the back, holding in his fixed hand, and regarding with stony eyes,
the daguerreotype of a woman and child. It was terribly suggestive
of the desolate homes and bleeding hearts which almost force one to
Cicero's conclusion, that any peace is better than the justest war. </p>

<div class="sidenote">An Interview with General Sherman.</div>

<p>General Sherman was very violent toward the Press. Some newspapers
had treated him unjustly early in the war. While he commanded in
Kentucky, his eccentricities were very remarkable, and a journalist
started the report that Sherman was crazy, which obtained wide
credence. There was, at least, method in his madness; for his
supposed insanity which declared that the Government required two
hundred thousand troops in the West, though hooted at the time,
proved wisdom and prophecy.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he was very erratic. When I first saw him in Missouri,
during Fremont's administration, his eye had a half-wild expression,
probably the result of excessive smoking. From morning till night he
was never without his cigar. To the nervous-sanguine temperament,
indicated by his blonde hair, light eyes, and fair complexion,
tobacco is peculiarly injurious.</p>

<p>While many insisted that no correspondent could meet Sherman without
being insulted, I sought him at his tent in the field; he was absent
with a scouting party, but soon returned, with one hand bandaged from
his Shiloh wound. A staff-officer introduced me:</p>

<p>"General, this is Mr. ----."</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mr. ----?" inquired Sherman, with great suavity,
offering me his uninjured hand.</p>

<p>"Correspondent of <cite>The New York Tribune</cite>," added the
lieutenant. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">His Complaints about the Press.</div>

<p>The general's manner changed from Indian summer to a Texas norther,
and he asked, in freezing tones:</p>

<p>"Have you not come to the wrong place, sir?"</p>

<p>"I think not. I want to learn some facts about the late battle from
your own lips. You complain that journalists misrepresent you. How
can they avoid it, when you refuse to give them proper information?
Some officers are drunkards and charlatans; but you would think it
unjust if we condemned all on that account. Is it not equally absurd
to anathematize every man of my profession for the sins of a few
unworthy members?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is. Sit down. Will you have a cigar? The trouble is, that
you of the Press have no responsibilities. Some worthless fellow,
wielding a quill, may send falsehoods about me to thousands of people
who can never hear them refuted. What can I do? His readers do not
know that he is without character. It would be useless to prosecute
him. If he would even fight there would be some satisfaction in that;
but a slanderer is likely to be a coward as well."</p>

<p>"True; but when some private citizen slanders you on the street or
in a drinking-saloon, you do not find it necessary to pull the nose
of every civilian whom you meet. Reputable journalists have just as
much pride in their profession as you have in yours. This tendency
to treat them superciliously and harshly, which encourages flippant
young staff-officers to insult them, tends to drive them home in
disgust, and leave their places to be supplied by a less worthy
class; so you only aggravate the evil you complain of."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sherman's Personal Appearance.</div>

<p>After further conversation on this subject, Sherman gave me a very
entertaining account of the battle. Since I first saw him, his eye
had grown much calmer, and his nervous system healthier. He is tall,
of bony frame, spare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
in flesh, with thin, wrinkled face, sandy beard and hair, and bright,
restless eyes. His face indicates great vitality and activity; his
manner is restless; his discourse rapid and earnest. He looks rather
like an anxious man of business than an ideal soldier, suggesting the
exchange, and not the camp.</p>

<p>He has great capacity for labor&mdash;sometimes working for twenty
consecutive hours. He sleeps little, nor do the most powerful opiates
relieve his terrible cerebral excitement. Indifferent to dress and to
fare, he can live on hard bread and water, and fancies any one else
can do so. Often irritable, and sometimes rude, he is a man of great
originality and daring, and a most valuable lieutenant for a general
of coolness and judgment, like Grant or Thomas. With one of them to
plan or modify, he is emphatically the man to execute. His purity
and patriotism are beyond all question. He did not enter the army to
speculate in cotton, or to secure a seat in the United States Senate,
but to serve the country.</p>

<p>Military weaknesses are often amusing. A prominent officer on
Halleck's staff, who had served with Scott in Mexico, had something
to do with fortifying Island Number Ten, after its capture. An
obscure country newspaper gave another officer the credit. Seeking
the agent of the Associated Press at Halleck's head-quarters, the
aggrieved engineer remarked:</p>

<p>"By the way, Mr. Weir, I have been carrying a paper in my pocket for
several days, but have forgotten to hand it to you. Here it is."</p>

<p>And he produced a letter page of denial, upon which the ink was
not yet dry, stating that the island had been fortified under the
immediate direction of General ----, the well-known officer of the
regular army, who served upon the staff of Lieutenant-General Scott
during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
Mexican war, and was at present ----, ----, and ---- upon the staff
of General Halleck.</p>

<p>"I rely upon your sense of justice," said this ornament of the staff,
"to give this proper publicity."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Humors of the Telegraph.</div>

<p>Mr. Weir, with a keen sense of the ridiculous, sent the long dispatch
word for word to the Associated Press, adding: "You may rest assured
that this is perfectly reliable, because every word of it was written
by the old fool himself!" All the newspaper readers in the country
had the formal dispatch, and all the telegraph corps had their
merriment over this confidential addendum.</p>

<p>Halleck's command contained eighty thousand effective men, who were
nearly all veterans. His line was ten miles in length, with Grant on
the right, Buell in the center, and Pope on the left.</p>

<p>The grand army was like a huge serpent, with its head pinned on
our left, and its tail sweeping slowly around toward Corinth. Its
majestic march was so slow that the Rebels had ample warning. It
was large enough to eat up Beauregard at one mouthful; but Halleck
crept forward at the rate of about three-quarters of a mile per day.
Thousands and thousands of his men died from fevers and diarrh&oelig;a.</p>

<p>There was great dissatisfaction at his slow progress. Pope was
particularly impatient. One day he had a very sharp skirmish with the
enemy. Our position was strong. General Palmer, who commanded on the
front, reported that he could hold it against the world, the flesh,
and the devil; but Halleck telegraphed to Pope three times within
an hour not to be drawn into a general engagement. After the last
dispatch, Pope retired, leaving the enemy in possession of the field.
How he did storm about it!</p>

<p>The little army which Pope had brought from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
capture of Island Number Ten was perfectly drilled and disciplined,
and he handled it with rare ability. Much of his subsequent
unpopularity arose from his imprudent and violent language. He
sometimes indulged in the most unseemly profanity and billingsgate
within hearing of a hundred people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Weaknesses of Sundry Generals.</div>

<p>But his personal weaknesses were pardonable compared with those of
some other prominent officers. During Fremont's Missouri campaign,
I knew one general who afterward enjoyed a well-earned national
reputation for skill and gallantry. His head-quarters were the scenes
of nightly orgies, where whisky punches and draw-poker reigned from
dark until dawn. In the morning his tent was a strange museum of
bottles, glasses, sugar-bowls, playing-cards, gold, silver, and
bank-notes. I knew another western officer, who, during the heat of a
Missouri battle, according to the newspaper reports, inspirited his
men by shouting:</p>

<p>"Go in, boys! Remember Lyon! Remember the old flag!"</p>

<p>He did use those words, but no enemy was within half a mile, and
he was lying drunk on the ground, flat upon his back. Afterward,
repenting in sackcloth and ashes, he did the State some service, and
his delinquency was never made public.</p>

<p>At Antietam, a general, well known both in Europe and America, was
reported disabled by a spent shell, which struck him in the breast.
The next morning, he gave me a minute history of it, assuring me that
he still breathed with difficulty and suffered greatly from internal
soreness. The fact was that he was disabled by a bottle of whisky,
having been too hospitable to that seductive friend!</p>

<div class="sidenote">"John Pope, Major-General Commanding."</div>

<p>After the evacuation of Corinth, Pope's reputation suffered greatly
from a false dispatch, asserting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
that he had captured ten thousand prisoners. Halleck alone was
responsible for the report. Pope was in the rear. One of his
subordinates on the front telegraphed him substantially as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"The woods are full of demoralized and flying Rebels.
   Some of my officers estimate their number as high as ten
   thousand. Many of them have already come into my lines."</p>
</div>

<p>Pope forwarded this message, which said nothing about taking
prisoners, to Halleck, without erasing or adding a line; and Halleck,
smarting under his mortifying failure at Corinth, telegraphed that
Pope reported the capture of ten thousand Rebels. Pope's reputation
for veracity was fatally wounded, and the newspapers burlesqued him
mercilessly.</p>

<p>One of my comrades lay sick and wounded at the residence of General
Clinton B. Fisk, of St. Louis. On a Sunday afternoon the general was
reading to him from the Bible an account of the first contraband.
This historic precedent was the servant of an Amalekite, who came
into David's camp and proposed, if assured of freedom, to show the
King of Israel a route which would enable him to surprise his foes.
The promise was given, and the king fell upon the enemy, whom he
utterly destroyed. While our host was reading the list of the spoils,
the prisoners, slaves, women, flocks and herds captured by David, the
sick journalist lifted his attenuated finger, and in his weak, piping
voice, said:</p>

<p>"Stop, General; just look down to the bottom of that list, and see if
it is not signed John Pope, Major-General commanding!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Halleck's Faux Pas at Corinth.</div>

<p>At last, Halleck's army reached Corinth, but the bird
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
had flown. No event of the war reflected so much credit upon the
Rebels and so much discredit upon the Unionists as Beauregard's
evacuation. He did not disturb himself until Halleck's Parrott guns
had thrown shots within fourteen feet of his own head-quarters. Then,
keeping up a vigorous show of resistance on his front, he deserted
the town, leaving behind not a single gun, or ambulance, or even a
sick or wounded man in the hospital.</p>

<p>Halleck lost thenceforth the name of "Old Brains," which some
imaginative person had given him, and which tickled for a time the
ears of his soldiers. The only good thing he ever did, in public, was
to make two brief speeches. When he first reached St. Louis, upon
being called out by the people, he said:</p>

<p>"With your help, I will drive the enemy out of Missouri."</p>

<p>Called upon again, on leaving St. Louis for Washington, to assume the
duties of general-in-chief, he made an equally brief response:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen: I promised to drive the enemy out of Missouri; I have
done it!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Out on the Front.</div>

<p class="quotdate"><i>May 11.</i></p>

<p>Still we creep slowly along. Pope's head-quarters are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
now within the borders of Mississippi. Out on his front you find
several hundred acres of cotton-field and sward, ridged with
graves from a recent hot skirmish. Carcasses of a hundred horses,
killed during the battle, are slowly burning under piles of rails,
covered with a layer of earth, that their decay may not taint the
atmosphere.</p>

<p>Beyond, our infantry pickets present muskets and order you to halt.
If you are accompanied by a field-officer, or bear a pass "by order
of Major-General Halleck," you can cross this Rubicon. A third of
a mile farther are our vedettes, some mounted, others lying in the
shade beside their grazing horses, but keeping a sharp look-out in
front. In a little rift of the woods, half a mile away, you see
through your field-glass a solitary horseman clad in butternut. Two
or three more, and sometimes forty or fifty, come out of the woods
and join him, but they keep very near their cover, and soon go back.
Those are the enemy's pickets. You hear the drum beat in the Rebel
lines, and the shrill whistle of the locomotives at Corinth, which is
three miles distant.</p>

<p class="quotdate"><i>May 19.</i></p>

<p>Along our entire front, almost daily, the long roll is sounded,
and the ground jarred by the dull rumble of cannonade. The little
attention paid to these skirmishes, where we lose from fifty to one
hundred men, illustrates the magnitude of the war.</p>

<p>We feel the earth vibrate, and look inquiringly into the office of
the telegraph which accompanies every corps.</p>

<p>"It is on Buell's center, or on Grant's right," the operator replies.</p>

<p>If it does not become rapid and prolonged, no further
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
questions are asked. At night, awakened by the sharp rattle of
musketry, we raise our heads, listen for the alarm-drum, and, not
hearing it, roll over in our blankets, to court again the drowsy
god.</p>

<p>Ride out with me to the front, five miles from Halleck's
head-quarters. The country is undulating and woody, with a few
cotton-fields and planters' houses. The beautiful groves open into
delicious vistas of green grass or rolling wheat; luxuriant flowers
perfume the vernal air, and the rich foliage already seems to
display&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Here is a deserted camp of a division which has moved forward.
Three or four adjacent farmers are gathering up the barrels, boxes,
provisions, and other <span lang="fr">d&eacute;bris</span>, left
behind by the troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Drilling, Digging, and Skirmishing.</div>

<p>Here is a division on drill, advancing in line of battle, the
skirmishers thrown out in front, deploying, gathering in groups, or
falling on their faces at the word of command.</p>

<p>Beyond those white tents our soldiers, in gray shirts and blue pants,
are busily plying the spade. They throw up a long rampart notched
with embrasures for cannon. We have already built fifty miles of
breastworks.</p>

<p>A little in the rear are the heavy siege-guns, where they can be
brought up quickly; a little in front, the field artillery, with
the horses harnessed and tied to trees, ready for use at a moment's
notice. Near the workmen, their comrades, who do the more legitimate
duty of the soldier, are standing on their arms, to repel any
<span lang="fr">sortie</span> from the enemy. Their guns, with the
burnished barrels

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
and bayonets glistening in the sun, are stacked in long rows, while
the men stand in little groups, or sit under the trees, playing
cards, reading letters or newspapers. More than twenty thousand
copies of the daily papers of the western cities and New York are
sold in the army at ten cents each. The number of letters which go
out from the camps in each day's mail is nearly as large.</p>

<p>When this parapet is completed, we shall go forward a few hundred
yards, and throw up another; and thus we advance slowly toward
Corinth.</p>

<p>Ride still farther, and you find the infantry pickets. The vedettes
are drawn in, if there is any skirmishing going on. From the extreme
front, you catch an occasional glimpse of the Rebels&mdash;"Butternuts,"
as they are termed in camp, from their cinnamon-hued homespun, dyed
with butternut extract. They are dodging among the trees, and, if you
are wise, you will get behind a tree yourself, and beware how you
show your head.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Experiences among the Sharp-shooters.</div>

<p>Already one of their sharp-shooters notices you. Puff, comes a cloud
of smoke from his rifle; in the same breath you hear the explosion,
and the sharp, ringing "ping" of the bullet through the air! Capital
shots are many of these long, lank, loose-jointed Mississippians
and Texans, whose rifles are sometimes effective at ten and twelve
hundred yards. Yesterday, one of them concealed himself in the dense
foliage of a tree-branch, and picked off several of our soldiers. At
last, one of our own sharp-shooters took him in hand, and, at the
sixth discharge, brought him down to the ground. This sharp-shooting
is a needless aggravation of the horrors of war; but if the enemy
indulges in it, you have no recourse but to do likewise. </p>

<div class="sidenote">Horses Stolen Every Day.</div>

<p>Stealing is the inevitable accompaniment of camp life&mdash;"convey, the
wise" call it. I have a steed, cadaverous and bony, but with good
locomotive powers. There was profound policy in my selection. For
five consecutive nights that horse was stolen, but no thief ever kept
him after seeing him by day-light. In the morning, he would always
come browsing back. My friend and tent-mate "Carlton," of <cite>The Boston
Journal</cite>, had a more vaulting ambition. He procured a showy horse,
which proved the most expensive luxury in all his varied experience.
The special aptitude of the animal was to be stolen. Regularly, seven
mornings in the week, our African factotum would thrust his woolly
head into the tent, and awaken us with this salutation:</p>

<p>"Breakfast is ready. Mr. Coffin, your horse is gone again."</p>

<p>By hard search and liberal rewards, he would be reclaimed during
the day from some cavalry soldier, who averred that he had found
him running loose. After being impaled and nearly killed upon a
rake-handle, the poor brute, hardly able to walk ten paces, was
stolen again, and never re-appeared. My friend now remembered his
showy steed, and the last five-dollar note which he sent in fruitless
pursuit, among blessings which brightened as they took their flight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Halleck Expels the War Correspondents.</div>

<p>General Halleck has expelled all the correspondents from the army,
on the plea that he must exclude "unauthorized hangers-on," to keep
spies out of his camps. His refusal to accept <em>any</em> guaranties of
their loyalty and prudence, even from the President himself, proves
that this plea was a shallow subterfuge. The real trouble is, that
Halleck is not willing to have his conduct exhibited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
to the country through any other medium than official reports. "As
false as a bulletin," has passed into a proverb.</p>

<p>The journalists received invitations to remain, from friends holding
commissions in the army, from major-generals down to lieutenants;
but, believing their presence just as legitimate and needful as that
of any soldier or officer, they determined not to skulk about camps
like felons, but all left in a body. Their individual grievances are
nothing to the public; but this is a grave issue between the Military
Power and the rights of the Press and the People. </p>

<div class="sidenote">Bloodthirstiness of Rebel Women.</div>

<p>No history of the war is likely to do full justice to the bitterness
of the Rebel women. Female influence tempted thousands of young
men to enter the Confederate service against their own wishes
and sympathies. Women sometimes evinced incredible rancor and
bloodthirstiness. The most startling illustration of the brutalizing
effect of Slavery appeared in the absence of that sweetness, charity,
and tenderness toward the suffering, which is the crowning grace of
womanhood.</p>

<p>A southern Unionist, the owner of many slaves, said to me:</p>

<p>"I suppose I have not struck any of my negroes for ten years. When
they need correcting, my wife always does it."</p>

<p>If he had a horse or a mule requiring occasional whipping, would
he put the scourge in the hands of his little daughter, and teach
her to wield it, from her tender years? How infinitely more must it
brutalize and corrupt her when the victim is a man&mdash;the most sacred
thing that God has made&mdash;his earthly image and his human temple!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Battle of Memphis.</div>

<p>Before we captured Memphis, the sick and wounded Union prisoners
were in a condition of great want and suffering. Women of education,
wealth, and high social position visited the hospitals to minister
to Rebel patients.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
Frequently entering the Federal wards from curiosity, they used
toward the groaning patients expressions like this:</p>

<p>"I would like to give you one dose! You would never fight against the
South again!"</p>

<p>In what happy contrast to this shone the self-denying ministrations
of northern women, to friend and enemy alike!</p>

<p>In Memphis, on the evening of June 5th, General Jeff. Thompson,
commanding the Rebel cavalry, and Commodore Edward Montgomery,
commanding the Rebel flotilla, stated at the Gayoso House that there
would be a battle the next morning, in which the Yankee fleet would
be destroyed in just about two hours.</p>

<p>Just after daylight, the Rebel flotilla attacked ours, two miles
above the city. We had five iron-clads and several rams, which
were then experimental. They were light, agile little stern-wheel
boats, whose machinery was not at all protected against shots. The
battle occurred in full view of the city. Though it began soon
after daylight, it was witnessed by ten thousand people upon the
high bluff&mdash;an anxious, excited crowd. The Rebels dared not be too
demonstrative, and the Unionists dared not whisper a word of their
long-cherished and earnest hopes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gallant Exploits of the Rams.</div>

<p>While the two fleets were steaming toward each other, Colonel Ellet,
determined to succeed or to die, daringly pushed forward with his
little rams, the Monarch and Queen of the West. With these boats,
almost as fragile as pasteboard, he steamed directly into the Rebel
flotilla. One of his rams struck the great gunboat Sterling Price
with a terrific blow, crushing timbers and tearing away the entire
larboard wheel-house. The Price drifted helplessly down the stream
and stranded. Another of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
Ellet's rams ran at full speed into the General Lovell, cutting her
in twain. The Rebel boat filled and sunk.</p>

<p>From the shore, it was a most impressive sight. There was the Lovell,
with holiday decorations, crowded with men and firing her guns, when
the little ram struck her, crushing in her side, and she went down
like a plummet. In three minutes, even the tops of her tall chimneys
disappeared under water. Scores of swimming and drowning Rebels in
the river were rescued by boats from the Union fleet.</p>

<p>One of the rams now ran alongside and grappled the Beauregard, and,
through hose, drenched her decks with scalding water, while her
cannoneers dared not show their heads to Ellet's sharpshooters, who
were within a few feet of them. Another Rebel boat came up to strike
the ram, but the agile little craft let go her hold and backed out.
The blow intended for her struck the Beauregard, which instantly went
down, "hoist with his own petar."</p>

<p>The Sumter and the Little Rebel, both disabled, were stranded on the
Arkansas shore. The Jeff. Thompson was set on fire and abandoned by
her crew. In a few minutes there was an enormous dazzling flash of
light, a measureless volume of black smoke, and a startling roar,
which seemed to shake the earth to its very center. For several
seconds the air was filled with falling timbers. Exploding her
magazine, the Rebel gunboat expired with a great pyrotechnic display.</p>

<p>The General Bragg received a fifty-pound shot, which tore off a
long plank under her water-mark, and she was captured in a sinking
condition. The Van Dorn, the only Rebel boat which survived the
conflict, turned and fled down the river.</p>

<p>The battle lasted just one hour and three minutes. It was the most
startling, dramatic, and memorable display
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
of the whole war. On our side, no one was injured except Colonel
Ellet, who had performed such unexampled feats with his little rams.
A splinter, which struck him in the leg, inflicted a fatal wound.</p>

<p>As our fleet landed, a number of news-boys sprang on shore, and, a
moment after, were running through the street, shouting:</p>

<p>"Here's your <cite>New-York Tribune</cite> and
<cite>Herald</cite>&mdash;only ten cents in silver!"</p>

<p>The correspondents, before the city was formally surrendered, had
strolled through the leading streets. At the Gayoso House they
registered their names immediately under those of the fugacious Rebel
general, and ordered dinner.</p>

<p>The Memphis Rebels, who had predicted a siege rivaling Saragossa and
Londonderry, were in a condition of stupor for two weeks after our
arrival. They rubbed their eyes wonderingly, to see Union officers
and Abolition journalists at large without any suggestions of hanging
or tarring and feathering. Remembering my last visit, it was with
peculiar satisfaction that I appended in enormous letters to my
signature upon the hotel register, the name of the journal I served.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Sailor on a Lark.</div>

<p>On the day of the capture, an intoxicated seaman from one of the
gun-boats, who had been shut up for several months, went on shore
"skylarking." Offering his arms to the first two negro women he met,
he promenaded the whole length of Main street. The Memphis Rebels
were suffering for an outrage, and here was one just to their mind.</p>

<p>"If that is the way, sir," remarked one of them, "that your people
propose to treat southern gentlemen and ladies&mdash;if they intend to
thrust upon us such a disgusting spectacle of negro equality, it will
be perilous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
for them. Do they expect to conciliate our people in this manner?"</p>

<p>I mildly suggested that the era of conciliation ceased when the era
of fighting began. The sailor was arrested and put in the guard-house.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Appearance of the Captured city.</div>

<p>Our officers mingled freely with the people. No citizens insulted our
soldiers in the streets; no woman repeated the disgraceful scenes of
New Orleans by spitting in the faces of the "invaders." The Unionists
received us as brothers from whom they had long been separated. One
lady brought out from its black hiding-place, in her chimney, a
National flag, which had been concealed there from the beginning of
the war. A Loyalist told me that, coming out of church on Sunday,
he was thrilled with the news that the Yankees had captured Fort
Donelson; but, with a grave face, he replied to his informant:</p>

<p>"That is sad business for us, is it not?"</p>

<p>Reaching home, with his wife and sister, they gave vent to their
exuberant joy. He could not huzza, and so he relieved himself by
leaping two or three times over a center-table!</p>

<p>There were many genuine Rebels whose eyes glared at us with the
hatred of caged tigers. Externally decorous, they would remark,
ominously, that they hoped our soldiers would not irritate the
people, lest it should deluge the streets with blood. They proposed
fabulous wagers that Sterling Price's troops could whip the whole
Union army; circulated daily reports that the Confederates had
recaptured New Orleans and Nashville, and talked mysteriously about
the fatality of the yellow fever, and the prospect that it would soon
break out.</p>

<p>Gladness shone from the eyes of all the negroes. Their dusky faces
were radiant with welcome, and many women, turbaned in bright
bandanas, thronged the office of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
the provost-marshal, applying for passage to the North. We found
Memphis as torpid as Syria, where Yusef Browne declared that he saw
only one man exhibit any sign of activity, and he was engaged in
tumbling from the roof of a house! But stores were soon opened, and
traders came crowding in from the North. Most of them were Jews.</p>

<p>Everywhere we saw the deep eyes and pronounced features of that
strange, enterprising people. I observed one of them, with the
Philistines upon him, marching to the military prison. The pickets
had caught him with ten thousand dollars' worth of boots and shoes,
which he was taking into Dixie. He bore the miscarriage with great
philosophy, bewailing neither his ducats nor his daughter, his boots
nor his liberty&mdash;smiling complacently, and finding consolation in
the vilest of cigars. But in his dark, sad eye was a gleam of latent
vengeance, which he doubtless wreaked upon the first unfortunate
customer who fell into his clutches after his release.</p>

<p>Glancing at the guests who crowded the dining-hall of the Gayoso, one
might have believed that the lost tribes of Israel were gathering
there for the Millennium.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grant Orders Away the Jews.</div>

<p>Many of them engaged in contraband traffic, supplying the Rebels
with food, and even with ammunition. Some months after, these very
gross abuses induced Grant to issue a sweeping ukase expelling
all Jews from his department&mdash;an order which the President wisely
countermanded.</p>

<p>The Rebel authorities had destroyed all the cotton, sugar, and
molasses they could find; but these articles now began to emerge
from novel hiding-places. One gentleman had fifty bales of cotton in
his closed parlor. Hundreds of bales were concealed in the woods, in
lofts, and in cellars. Much sugar was buried. One man, entombing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
fifteen hogsheads, neglected to throw up a mound to turn off the
water; when he dug for his sugar, its linked sweetness was <em>too</em> long
drawn out! The hogsheads were empty.</p>

<p>On the 17th of June, a little party of Union officers came galloping
into the city from the country. They were evidently no gala-day
soldiers. Their sun-browned faces, dusty clothing, and jaded horses
bespoke hard campaigns and long marches.</p>

<p>One horseman, in a blue cap and plain blouse, bore no mark of rank,
but was noticeable for the peculiar brilliancy of his dark, flashing
eye. This modest soldier was Major-General Lew. Wallace; and his
division arrived a few hours after. He established his quarters
at the Gayoso, in the same apartments which had been occupied
successively by four Rebel commanders, Pillow, Polk, Van Dorn, and
Price.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Rebel Paper Supervised.</div>

<p><cite>The Memphis Argus</cite>, a bitter Secession sheet, had
been allowed to continue publication, though its tone was very
objectionable. General Wallace at once addressed to the proprietors
the following note:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"As the closing of your office might be injurious to
   you pecuniarily, I send Messrs. Richardson, of <cite>The
   New York Tribune</cite>, and Knox, of <cite>The New York
   Herald</cite>,&mdash;two gentlemen of ample experience&mdash;to take
   charge of the editorial department of your paper. The business and
   management will be left to you."</p>
</div>

<p>The publishers, glad to continue upon any terms, acquiesced, and
thereafter every morning, before <cite>The Argus</cite> went to press, the
proof-sheets were sent to us for revision.</p>

<p>The first dress-parade of Wallace's original regiment, the Eleventh
Indiana Infantry, was attended by hundreds of Memphians, curious to
see northern troops
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
drawn up in line. They wore no bright trappings or holiday attire.
Their well-kept arms shone in the fading sunlight, a line of polished
steel; but their soiled uniforms had left their brightness behind
in many hard-fought battles. They went through the drill with rare
precision. The Rebel bystanders clapped their hands heartily,
with a certain unconscious pride that these soldiers were their
fellow-Americans. The spectacle dimmed their faith in their favorite
five-to-one theory.</p>

<p>"Well, John," asked one of them beside me, "how many regiments like
that do you think one of ours could whip?"</p>

<p>"I think that whipping one would be a pretty hard day's work!" was
the reply.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"A Dam Black-Harted Ablichiness."</div>

<p>Months before our arrival, a Union employ&eacute; of the Memphis and Ohio
Railroad sold a watch to a Secession comrade. Vainly attempting to
collect the pay, he finally wrote a pressing letter. The debtor sent
back the dun with this reply:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>: My privet Apinion is Public

   cent Back to you free nigar Land Whar you be along these are fackes
   and you now I can prove them and I will Doet."</p>
</div>

<p>The Loyalist pocketed the affront, "ablichiness" and all, and
nursed his wrath to keep it warm. Meeting his debtor on the street,
after the arrival of our forces, he administered to him a merciless
flagellation. Before our Provost-Marshal it was decided to be a
case of "justifiable assault," and the prisoner was discharged from
custody.</p>

<p>Confederate currency was a curiosity of literature and finance.
Dray-tickets and checks, marked "Good for twenty-five cents," and a
great variety of shinplasters, were current. One, issued by a baker,
represented "twenty-five cents in drayage or confectionary," at the
option of the holder. Another guaranteed to the bearer "the sum of
five cents from the Mississippi and Tennessee Railroad Company, in
freight or passage!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Droll Species of Currency.</div>

<p>One of my acquaintances had purchased in Chicago, at ten cents a
dozen, lithographic <span lang="fr">fac-similes</span> of the regular
Confederate notes, promising to pay to the bearer ten dollars, six
months after a treaty of peace between the United States and the
Confederate States. A Memphis merchant, knowing that they were
counterfeit, manufactured only to sell as curiosities, considered
their execution so much better than the originals, that he gladly
gave Tennessee bank-notes in exchange for them. My friend subsisted
at his hotel for several days upon the proceeds of these <span
lang="fr">fac-similes</span>, and thought it cheap boarding. While
Curtis's army was in northern Arkansas, our officers found at a
village druggist's several large sheets of his

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
printed promises to pay, neither cut nor signed. At the next village
one of them purchased a canteen of whisky, and offered the grocer a
National treasury note in payment. The trader refused it; it was,
doubtless, good, but might cause him trouble after the army had
left. He would receive either gold or Confederate money. The officer
exhibited one of these blanks, and asked if he would take <em>that</em>. "O
yes," he replied; "it is as good money as I want!" And he actually
sold two hundred and fifty canteens of whisky for those unsigned
shinplasters, cut off from the sheets in his presence!</p>

<p>Late in June, General Grant, accompanied only by his personal staff,
often rode from Corinth to Memphis, ninety miles, through a region
infested by guerrillas.</p>

<p>The guests at the Gayoso House regarded with much curiosity the
quiet, slightly-stooping, rural-looking man in cotton coat and
broad-brimmed hat, talking little and smoking much, who was already
beginning to achieve world-wide reputation.</p>

<p>A party of native Arkansans, including a young lady, arrived in
Memphis, coming up the Mississippi in an open skiff. When leaving
home they expected to encounter some of our gun-boats in a few hours,
and provided themselves only with one day's food, and an ample supply
of champagne. Accustomed to luxury, and all unused to labor, in the
unpitying sun they rowed for five days against the strong current
of the Mississippi, burnt, sick, and famishing. For five nights
they slept upon the ground on the swampy shore, half devoured by
musquitoes. At last they found an ark of safety in the iron-clad St.
Louis.</p>

<p>During a fight at St. Charles, on the White River, the steam-drum of
the gun-boat Mound City was exploded by a Rebel shot. The terrified
gunners and seamen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
many of them horribly scalded, jumped into the water. The
Confederates, from behind trees on the bank, deliberately shot the
scalded and drowning wretches!</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Clever Rebel Trick.</div>

<p>Halleck continued in command at Corinth. From some cause, his
official telegrams to General Curtis, in Arkansas, and Commodore
Davis, on the Mississippi, were not transmitted in cipher; and
the line was unguarded, though leading through an intensely Rebel
region. In July, the Memphis operators, from the difficult working
of their instruments, surmised that some outsider must be sharing
their telegraphic secrets. One day the transmission of a message was
suddenly interrupted by the ejaculation:</p>

<p>"Pshaw! Hurra for Jeff Davis!"</p>

<p>Individuality reveals itself as clearly in telegraphing as in the
footstep or handwriting. Mr. Hall, the Memphis operator, instantly
recognized the performer&mdash;by what the musicians would call his
"time"&mdash;as a former telegraphic associate in the North; and sent him
this message:</p>

<p>"Saville, if you don't want to be hung, you had better leave. Our
cavalry is closing in on all sides of you."</p>

<p>After a little pause, the surprised Rebel replied:</p>

<p>"How in the world did you know me? I have been here four days, and
learned about all your military secrets; but it is becoming a rather
tight place, and I think I <em>will</em> leave. Good-by, boys."</p>

<p>He made good his escape. In the woods he had cut the wire, inserted
one of his own, and by a pocket instrument perused our official
dispatches, stating the exact number and location of United States
troops in Memphis. Re-enforcements were immediately ordered in, to
guard against a Rebel dash.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Bit of Sherman's Waggery.</div>

<p>Later in July, Sherman assumed command. One day,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
a bereaved man-owner visited him, to learn how he could reclaim his
runaway slaves.</p>

<p>"I know of only one way, sir," replied the general, "and that is,
through the United States marshal."</p>

<p>The unsuspecting planter went up and down the city inquiring for that
civil officer.</p>

<p>"Have you any business with him?" asked a Federal captain.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I want my negroes. General Sherman says he is the proper
person to return them."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly he is. The law prescribes it."</p>

<p>"Is he in town?"</p>

<p>"I rather suspect not."</p>

<p>"When do you think he left?"</p>

<p>"About the time Sumter was fired on, I fancy."</p>

<p>At last it dawned upon the planter's brain that the Fugitive Slave
Law was void after the people drove out United States officers. He
went sadly back to Sherman, and asked if there was no other method of
recovering his chattels.</p>

<p>"None within my knowledge, sir."</p>

<p>"What can I do about it?"</p>

<p>"The law provided a remedy for you slaveholders in cases like this;
but you were dissatisfied and smashed the machine. If you don't like
your work, you had better set it to running again."</p>

<p>On the 7th and 8th of March, 1862, occurred the battle of
Pea Ridge, in Arkansas. Our troops were commanded by General
Curtis. Vandeveer's brigade made a forced march of forty-one
miles between 2 o'clock <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>, and 10
<span class="smcap">p. m.</span>, in order to participate in the
engagement. The fight was very severe, but the tenacity of the
western soldiers finally routed the Rebels.</p>

<p>There chanced to be only one New York correspondent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
with Curtis's command. During the battle he was wounded by a fragment
of shell. He sent forward his report, with calm complacency,
presuming that it was exclusive.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fictitious Battle Reports.</div>

<p>But two other New York journalists in St. Louis, hearing of the
battle, at once repaired to Rolla, the nearest railway point, though
one hundred and ninety-five miles distant from Pea Ridge. Perusing
the very meager official dispatches, knowing what troops were
engaged, and learning from an old countryman the topography of the
field, they wrote elaborate accounts of the two days' conflict.</p>

<p>Indebted to their imagination for their facts, they gave minute
details and a great variety of incidents. Their reports were
plausible and graphic. <cite>The London Times</cite> reproduced one
of them, pronouncing it the ablest and best battle account which
had been written during the American war. For months, the editors
who originally published these reports, did not know that they were
fictitious. They were written only as a Bohemian freak, and remained
the only accounts manufactured by any reputable journalist during the
war.</p>

<p>After the battle, Curtis's army, fifteen thousand strong, pursued
its winding way through the interior of Arkansas. It maintained no
communications, carrying its base of supplies along with it. When out
of provisions, it would seize and run all the neighboring corn-mills,
until it obtained a supply of meal for one or two weeks, and then
move forward.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Curtis's Great March through Arkansas.</div>

<p>Day after day, the Memphis Rebels told us, with ill-concealed glee,
that Curtis's army, after terrific slaughter, had all been captured,
or was just about to surrender. For weeks we had no reliable
intelligence from it. But suddenly it appeared at Helena, on the
Mississippi,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
seventy-five miles below Memphis, having marched more than six
hundred miles through the enemy's country. Despite the unhealthy
climate, the soldiers arrived in excellent sanitary condition, weary
and ragged, but well, and with an immense train of followers. It was
a common jest, that every private came in with one horse, one mule,
and two negroes.</p>

<p>The army correspondents, disgusted with the hardships and unwholesome
fare of Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Mississippi, often
predicted, with what they thought extravagant humor:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When Cincinnati or Chicago becomes the seat of war, all this will
be changed. We will take our ease at our inn, and view battles
&aelig;sthetically."</p>

<p>But in September, this jest became the literal truth. Bragg, leaving
Buell far behind in Tennessee, invaded Kentucky, and seriously
threatened Cincinnati.</p>

<p>Martial law was declared, and all Cincinnati began arming, drilling,
or digging. In one day, twenty-five thousand citizens enrolled their
names, and were organized into companies. Four thousand worked upon
the Covington fortifications. Newspaper proprietors were in the
trenches. Congressmen, actors, and artists, carried muskets or did
staff duty.</p>

<p>A few sneaks were dragged from their hiding-places in back kitchens,
garrets, and cellars. One fellow was found in his wife's clothing,
scrubbing away at the wash-tub. He was suddenly stripped of his
crinoline by the German guard, who, with shouts of laughter, bore him
away to a working-party.</p>

<p>New regiments of volunteers came pouring in from Indiana,
Michigan, and the other Northwestern States. The farmers, young
and old, arrived by thousands, with their shot-guns and their
old squirrel-rifles. The market houses,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
public buildings, and streets, were crowded with them. They came even
from New York and Pennsylvania, until General Wallace was compelled
to telegraph in all directions that no more were needed.</p>

<p>One of these country boys had no weapon except an old Revolutionary
sword. Quite a crowd gathered one morning upon Sycamore street, where
he took out his rusty blade, scrutinized its blunt edge, knelt down,
and carefully whetted it for half an hour upon a door-stone; then,
finding it satisfactorily sharp, replaced it in the scabbard, and
turned away with a satisfied look. His gravity and solemnity made it
very ludicrous.</p>

<p>Buell, before starting northward in pursuit of Bragg, was about to
evacuate Nashville. Andrew Johnson, Military Governor of Tennessee,
implored, expostulated, and stormed, but without effect. He solemnly
declared that, if all the rest of the army left, he would remain with
his four Middle Tennessee regiments, defend the city to the last,
and perish in its ashes, before it should be given up to the enemy.
Buell finally left a garrison, which, though weak in numbers, proved
sufficient to hold Nashville.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"The Siege of Cincinnati."</div>

<p>The siege of Cincinnati proved of short duration. Buell's veterans,
and the enthusiastic new volunteers soon sent the Rebels flying
homeward. Then, as through the whole war, their appearance north of
Tennessee and Virginia was the sure index of disaster to their arms.
Southern military genius did not prove adapted to the establishment
of a navy, or to fighting on Northern soil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gloomiest Days of the War.</div>

<p>Maryland invaded, Frankfort abandoned, Nashville evacuated, Tennessee
and Kentucky given up almost without a fight, the Rebels threatening
the great commercial metropolis of Ohio&mdash;these were the disastrous,
humiliating tidings of the hour. These were, perhaps,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
the gloomiest days that had been seen during the war. We were paying
the bitter penalty of many years of National wrong.</p>

<p>An hour afterward I was upon an eastern train.</p>

<p>At the Capital, I found orders to join the Army of the Potomac. It

leading officials nearly doubled the Confederate army, estimating it
at two hundred thousand men.</p>

<p>Reaching Frederick, Maryland, I found more Union flags,
proportionately, in that little city, than I had ever seen elsewhere.
The people were intensely loyal. Four miles beyond, in a mountain
region, I saw winding, fertile valleys of clear streams, rich
in broad corn-fields; and white vine-covered farm-houses, half
hidden in old apple-orchards; while great hay and grain stacks
surrounded&mdash;</p>

<p>The roads were full of our advancing forces, with bronzed faces
and muscles compacted by their long campaigning. They had just won
the victory of South Mountain, where Hooker found exercise for his
peculiar genius in fighting above the clouds, and driving the enemy
by an impetuous charge from a dizzy and apparently inaccessible hight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">On the War-Path.</div>

<p>The heroic Army of the Potomac, which had suffered more, fought
harder, and been defeated oftener than any other National force, was
now marching cheerily under the unusual inspiration of victory. But
what fearful loads the soldiers carried! Gun, canteen, knapsack,
haversack, pack of blankets and clothing, often must have reached
fifty pounds to the man. These modern Atlases had little chance in a
race with the Rebels.</p>

<p>There were crowds of sorry-looking prisoners marching to the rear;
long trains of ambulances filled with our wounded soldiers, some of
them walking back with their arms in slings, or bloody bandages about
their necks or foreheads; Rebel hospitals, where unfortunate fellows
were groaning upon the straw, with arms or legs missing; eleven of
our lost, resting placidly side by side, while their comrades were
digging their graves hard by; the unburied dead of the enemy, lying
in pairs or groups, behind rocks or in fence corners; and then a
Rebel surgeon, in bluish-gray uniform, coming in with a flag of
truce, to look after his wounded.</p>

<p>All the morning I heard the pounding of distant guns, and at
4 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>, near the little village of
Keedysville, I reached our front. On the extreme left I found an old
friend whom I had not met for many years&mdash;Colonel Edward E.
Cross, of the Fifth New Hampshire Infantry. Formerly a Cincinnati
journalist, afterward a miner in Arizona, and then a colonel at the
head of a Mexican regiment, his life had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
full of interest and romance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Novel Kind of Duel.</div>

<p>While living in Arizona he incurred the displeasure of the
pro-Slavery politicians, who ruled the territory. Mowry, their
self-styled Delegate to Congress, challenged him&mdash;probably upon the
hypothesis that, as a Northerner, he would not recognize the code;
but Cross was an ugly subject for that experiment. He promptly
accepted, and named Burnside rifles at ten paces! Mowry was probably
ready to say with Falstaff&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"An' I thought he had been valiant and so cunning in fence,
      I'd have seen him damned ere I had challenged him."</p>
</div>

<p>Both were dead shots. Their seconds placed them across the strong
prairie wind, to interfere with their aim. At the first fire, a ball
grazed Mowry's ear. At the second, a lock of Cross's hair was cut
off.</p>

<p>"Rather close work, is it not?" he calmly asked of a bystander.</p>

<p>At the third fire, Mowry's rifle missed. His friends insisted that
he was entitled to his fire. Those of the other party declared that
this was monstrous, and that he should be killed if he attempted it.
But Cross settled the difficulty by deciding that Mowry was right,
and stood serenely, with folded arms, to receive the shot. The
would-be Delegate was wise enough to fire into the air. Thus ended
the bloodless duel, and the journalist was never challenged again.
</p>

<p>A year or two later, I chanced to be in El Paso, Mexico, shortly
after Cross had visited that ancient city. An old cathedral, still
standing, was built before the landing of the Pilgrims on Plymouth
Rock. Ascending to the steeple, Cross pocketed and brought away
the clapper of the old Spanish bell, which was hung there when the
edifice was erected.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
The devout natives were greatly exasperated at this profanation,
and would have killed the relic-hunting Yankee had they caught him.
I heard from them a great deal of swearing in bad Spanish on the
subject.</p>

<p>Now, when I greeted him, his men were deployed in a corn-field,
skirmishing with the enemy's pickets. He was in a barn, where the
balls constantly whistled, and occasionally struck the building. He
had just come in from the front, where Confederate bullets had torn
two rents in the shoulder of his blouse, without breaking the skin.
A straggling soldier passed us, strolling down the road toward the
Rebel pickets.</p>

<p>"My young friend," said Cross, "if you don't want a hole through
you, you had better come back."</p>

<p>Just as he spoke, ping! came a bullet, perforating the hat of the
private, who made excellent time toward the rear. A moment after,
a shell exploded on a bank near us, throwing the dirt into our
faces.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How Correspondents Avoided Expulsion.</div>

<p>We spent the night at the house of a Union resident, of
Keedysville. General Marcy, McClellan's father-in-law and chief
of staff, who supped there, inquired, with some curiosity, how
we had gained admission to the lines, as journalists were then
nominally excluded from the army. We assured him that it was only by
"strategy," the details whereof could not be divulged to outsiders.
</p>

<p>One of the <cite>Tribune</cite> correspondents had not left the army since
the Peninsular campaign, and, remaining constantly within the
lines, his position had never been questioned. Another, who had a
nominal appointment upon the staff of a major-general, wore a saber
and passed for an officer. I had an old pass, without date, from
General Burnside, authorizing the bearer to go to and fro from his
head-quarters at all times, which enabled me to go by all guards with
ease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>Marcy engaged lodgings at the house for McClellan; but an hour
after, a message was received that the general thought it better to
sleep upon the ground, near the bivouac-fires, as an example for the
troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shameful Surrender of Harper's Ferry.</div>

<p>Last night came intelligence of the surrender, to Stonewall
Jackson, of Harper's Ferry, including the impregnable position of
Maryland Hights and our army.</p>

<p>Colonel Miles, who commanded, atoned for his weakness with his
life, being killed by a stray shot just after he had capitulated.
Colonel Thomas H. Ford, ex-Lieutenant-Governor of Ohio, who was
stationed on the Hights, professed to have a written order from
Miles, his superior officer, to exercise his own discretion about
evacuating; but he could not exhibit the paper, and stated that he
had lost it. He gave up that key to the position without a struggle.
It was like leaving the rim of a teacup, to go down to the bottom
for a defensive point. He was afterward tried before a court-martial,
but saved from punishment, and permitted to resign, through the
clemency of President Lincoln. In any other country he would have
been shot.</p>

<p>On September 16th, General McClellan established his head-quarters
in a great shaded brick farm-house.</p>

<p>Under one of the old trees sat General Sumner, at sixty-four
erect, agile, and soldierly, with snow-white hair. A few yards
distant, in an open field, a party of officers were suddenly
startled by two shells which dropped very near them. The group broke
up and scattered with great alacrity.</p>

<p>"Why," remarked Sumner, with a peculiar smile, "the shells seem to
excite a good deal of commotion among those young gentlemen!"</p>

<p>It appeared to amuse and surprise the old war-horse that anybody
should be startled by bullets or shots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>Lying upon the ground near by, with his head resting upon his arm,
was another officer wearing the two stars of a major-general.</p>

<p>"Who is that?" I asked of a journalistic friend.</p>

<p>"Fighting Joe Hooker," was the answer.</p>

<p>With his side-whiskers, rather heavy countenance, and transparent
cheeks, which revealed the blood like those of a blushing girl, he
hardly looked all my fancy had painted him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Cavalry Stampede.</div>

<p>Toward evening, at the head of his corps, preceded by the pioneers
tearing away fences for the column, Hooker led a forward movement
across Antietam Creek. His milk-white horse, a rare target to Rebel
sharpshooters, could be seen distinctly from afar against the deep
green landscape. I could not believe that he was riding into battle
upon such a steed, for it seemed suicidal.</p>

<p>In an hour we halted, and the cavalry went forward to reconnoiter.
A few minutes after, Mr. George W. Smalley, of <cite>The
Tribune</cite>, said to me:</p>

<p>"There will be a cavalry stampede in about five minutes. Let us
ride out to the front and see it."</p>

<p>Galloping up the road, and waiting two or three minutes, we heard
three six-pound shots in rapid succession, and a little fifer who had
climbed a tree, shouted:</p>

<p>"There they come, like the devil, with the Rebels after them!"</p>

<p>From a vast cloud of dust, emerged soon our troopers in hot haste and
disorder. They had suddenly awakened a Rebel battery, which opened
upon them.</p>

<p>"We will stir them up," said Hooker, as the cavalry commander made
his report.</p>

<p>"Why, General," replied the major, "they have some batteries up
there!"</p>

<p>"Well, sir," answered Hooker,
"<del>have'nt</del><ins>haven't</ins> we got as many batteries as
they have? Move on!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">"Fighting Joe Hooker" in Battle.</div>

<p>McClellan, who had accompanied the expedition thus far, rode back
to the rear. Hooker pressed forward, accompanied by General Meade,
then commanding a division&mdash;a dark-haired, scholarly-looking
gentleman in spectacles. The grassy fields, the shining streams, and
the vernal forests, stretched out in silent beauty. With their bright
muskets, clean uniforms, and floating flags, Hooker's men moved on
with assured faces.</p>

<div class="poem">
   <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i0">"'Twere worth ten years of peaceful life,</span>
      <span class="i0">One glance at their array."</span>
   </div>
</div>

<p>With a very heavy force of skirmishers, we pushed on, finding no
enemy. Our line was three-quarters of a mile in length. Hooker was on
the extreme right, close upon the skirmishers.</p>

<p>As we approached a strip of woods, a hundred yards wide, far on our
extreme left, we heard a single musket. Then there was another, then
another, and in an instant our whole line blazed like a train of
powder, in one long sheet of flame.</p>

<p>Right on our front, through the narrow belt of woods, so near that it
seemed that we might toss a pebble to them, rose a countless horde of
Rebels, almost instantly obscured by the fire from their muskets and
the smoke of the batteries.</p>

<p>My <span lang="fr">confr&egrave;re</span> and myself were within
a few yards of Hooker. It was a very hot place. We could not
distinguish the "ping" of the individual bullets, but their combined
and mingled hum was like the din of a great Lowell factory. Solid
shot and shell came shrieking through the air, but over our heads, as
we were on the extreme front.</p>

<p>Hooker&mdash;common-place before&mdash;the moment he heard the guns, loomed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
up into gigantic stature. His eye gleamed with the grand anger of
battle. He seemed to know exactly what to do, to feel that he was
master of the situation, and to impress every one else with the fact.
Turning to one of his staff, and pointing to a spot near us, he
said:</p>

<p>"Go, and tell Captain ---- to bring his battery and plant it there
at once!"</p>

<p>The lieutenant rode away. After giving one or two further orders with
great clearness, rapidity, and precision, Hooker's eye turned again
to that mass of Rebel infantry in the woods, and he said to another
officer, with great emphasis:</p>

<p>"Go, and tell Captain ---- to bring his battery here instantly!"</p>

<p>Sending more messages to the various divisions and batteries, only
a single member of the staff remained. Once more scanning the woods
with his eager eye, Hooker directed the aid:</p>

<p>"Go, and tell Captain ---- to bring that battery here without one
second's delay. Why, my God, how he can pour it into their infantry!"</p>

<p>By this time, several of the body-guard had fallen from their
saddles. Our horses plunged wildly. A shell plowed the ground under
my rearing steed, and another exploded near Mr. Smalley, throwing
great clouds of dust over both of us. Hooker leaped his white
horse over a low fence into an adjacent orchard, whither we gladly
followed. Though we did not move more than thirty yards, it took us
comparatively out of range.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Rebels Waver and Break.</div>

<p>The desired battery, stimulated by three successive messages, came up
with smoking horses, at a full run, was unlimbered in the twinkling
of an eye, and began to pour shots into the enemy, who were also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
suffering severely from our infantry discharges. It was not many
seconds before they began to waver. Through the rifting smoke, we
could see their line sway to and fro; then it broke like a thaw in
a great river. Hooker rose up in his saddle, and, in a voice of
suppressed thunder, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"There they go, G-d d--n them! Forward!"</p>

<p>Our whole line moved on. It was now nearly dark. Having shared the
experience of "Fighting Joe Hooker" quite long enough, I turned
toward the rear. Fresh troops were pressing forward, and stragglers
were ranged in long lines behind rocks and trees.</p>

<p>Riding slowly along a grassy slope, as I supposed quite out of
range, my meditations were disturbed by a cannon-ball, whose rush
of air fanned my face, and made my horse shrink and rear almost
upright. The next moment came another behind me, and by the great
blaze of a fire of rails, which the soldiers had built, I saw it
<span lang="fr">ricochet</span> down the slope, like a foot-ball, and
pass right through a column of our troops in blue, who were marching
steadily forward. The gap which it made was immediately closed up.</p>

<p>Men with litters were groping through the darkness, bearing the
wounded back to the ambulances.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Night Among the Pickets.</div>

<p>At nine o'clock, I wandered to a farm-house, occupied by some of our
pickets. We dared not light candles, as it was within range of the
enemy. The family had left. I tied my horse to an apple-tree, and lay
down upon the parlor floor, with my saddle for a pillow. At intervals
during the night, we heard the popping of musketry, and at the first
glimpse of dawn the picket-officer shook me by the arm.</p>

<p>"My friend," said he, "you had better go away as soon as you can;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
this place is getting rather hot for civilians."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Battle of Antietam.</div>

<p>I rode around through the field, for shot and shell were already
screaming up the narrow lane.</p>

<p>Thus commenced the long, hotly-contested battle of Antietam. Our line
was three miles in length, with Hooker on the right, Burnside on the
left, and a great gap in the middle, occupied only by artillery;
while Fitz-John Porter, with his fine corps, was held in reserve.
From dawn until nearly dark, the two great armies wrestled like
athletes, straining every muscle, losing here, gaining there, and at
many points fighting the same ground over and over again. It was a
fierce, sturdy, indecisive conflict.</p>

<p>Five thousand spectators viewed the struggle from a hill
comparatively out of range. Not more than three persons were struck
there during the day. McClellan and his staff occupied another ridge
half a mile in the rear.</p>

<div class="poem">
   <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i0">"By Heaven! it was a goodly sight to see,<br /></span>
      <span class="i0">For one who had no friend or brother there."<br /></span>
   </div>
</div>

<p>No one who looked upon that wonderful panorama can describe or forget
it. Every hill and valley, every corn-field, grove, and cluster of
trees, was fiercely fought for.</p>

<p>The artillery was unceasing; we could often count more than sixty
guns to the minute. It was like thunder; and the musketry sounded
like the patter of rain-drops in an April shower. On the great field
were riderless horses and scattering men, clouds of dirt from solid
shot and exploding shells, long dark lines of infantry swaying to and
fro, with columns of smoke rising from their muskets, red flashes and
white puffs from the batteries&mdash;with the sun shining brightly on all
this scene of tumult, and beyond it, upon the dark, rich woods, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
the clear blue mountains south of the Potomac.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fearful Slaughter in the Corn-field.</div>

<p>We saw clearly our entire line, except the extreme left, where
Burnside was hidden by intervening ridges; and at times the infantry
and cavalry of the Rebels. We could see them press our men, and
hear their shrill yells of triumph. Then our columns in blue would
move forward, driving them back, with loud, deep-mouthed, sturdy
cheers. Once, a great mass of Rebels, in brown and gray, came pouring
impetuously through a corn-field, forcing back the Union troops.
For a moment both were hidden under a hill; and then up, over the
slope came our soldiers, flying in confusion, with the enemy in hot
pursuit. But soon after, up rose and opened upon them two long lines
of men in blue, with shining muskets, who, hidden behind a ridge, had
been lying in wait. The range was short, and the fire was deadly.</p>

<p>The Rebels instantly poured back, and were again lost for a moment
behind the hill, our troops hotly following. In a few seconds, they
reappeared, rushing tumultuously back into the corn-field. While
they were so thick that they looked like swarming bees, one of our
batteries, at short range, suddenly commenced dropping shots among
them. We could see with distinctness the explosions of the shells,
and sometimes even thought we detected fragments of human bodies
flying through the air. In that field, the next day, I counted
sixty-four of the enemy's dead, lying almost in one mass.</p>

<p>Hooker, wounded before noon, was carried from the field. Had he not
been disabled, he would probably have made it a decisive conflict.
Realizing that it was one of the world's great days, he said:</p>

<p>"I would gladly have compromised with the enemy by receiving a mortal
wound at night, could I have remained at the head of my troops until
the sun went down."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p>On the left, Burnside, who had a strong, high stone bridge to carry,
was sorely pressed. McClellan denied his earnest requests for
re-enforcements, though the best corps of the army was then held in
reserve.</p>

<p>The Fifteenth Massachusetts Infantry took into the battle five
hundred and fifty men, and brought out only one hundred and
fifty-six. The Nineteenth Massachusetts, out of four hundred and
six men, lost all but one hundred and forty-seven, including every
commissioned officer above a first lieutenant. The Fifth New
Hampshire, three hundred strong, lost one hundred and ten privates
and fourteen officers. Colonel Cross, who seldom went into battle
without receiving wounds, was struck in the head by a piece of shell
early in the day, but with face crimsoned and eyes dimmed with blood,
he led his men until night closed the indecisive conflict.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Best Battle-Report of the War.</div>

<p>At night, the four <cite>Tribune</cite> correspondents, who had
witnessed the battle, met at a little farm-house. They prepared hasty
reports, by a flickering tallow candle, in a narrow room crowded with
wounded and dying.</p>

<p>Mr. Smalley had been with Hooker from the firing of the first gun.
Twice his horse had been shot under him, and twice his clothing
was cut by bullets. Without food, without sleep, greatly exhausted
physically and mentally, he started for New York, writing his report
on a railway train during the night, by a very dim light.</p>

<p>Reaching New York at seven in the morning, he found the printers
awaiting him; and, an hour later, his account of the conflict,
filling five <cite>Tribune</cite> columns, was being cried in the
streets by the news-boys. Notwithstanding the adverse circumstances
of its preparation, it was vivid and truthful, and was considered the
best battle-report of the war.</p>

   </div>
</div>

<p>In a lull of the musketry, during the battle of Antietam, McClellan
rode forward toward the front. On the way, he met a Massachusetts
general, who was his old friend and class-mate.</p>

<p>"Gordon," he asked, "how are your men?"</p>

<p>"They have behaved admirably," replied Gordon; "but they are now
somewhat scattered."</p>

<p>"Collect them at once. We must fight to-night and fight to-morrow.
This is our golden opportunity. If we cannot whip the Rebels here, we
may just as well all die on the field."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Day After the Battle.</div>

<p>That was the spirit of the whole army. It was universally expected
that McClellan would renew the attack at daylight the next morning;
but, though he had many thousand fresh men, and defeat could only
be repulse to him, while to the enemy, with the river in his rear,
it would be ruin, his constitutional timidity prevented. It was the
costliest of mistakes.</p>

<p>Thursday proved a day of rest&mdash;such rest as can be found
with three miles of dead men to bury, and thousands of wounded to
bring from the field. It was a day of standing on the line where the
battle closed&mdash;of intermittent sharp-shooting and discharges of
artillery,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
but no general skirmishing, or attempt to advance on either side.</p>

<p>Riding out to the front of General Couch's line, I found the Rebels
and our own soldiers mingling freely on the disputed ground, bearing
away the wounded. I was scanning a Rebel battery with my field-glass,
at the distance of a quarter of a mile, when one of our pickets
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Put up your glass, sir! The Johnnies will shoot in a minute, if they
see you using it."</p>

<p>In front of Hancock's lines, a flag of truce was raised.
Hancock&mdash;erect and soldierly, with smooth face, light eyes, and
brown hair, the finest-looking general in our service&mdash;accompanied
by Meagher, rode forward into a corn-field, and met the young
fire-eating brigadier of the Rebels, Roger A. Pryor. Pryor insisted
that he had seen a white flag on our front, and asked if we desired
permission to remove our dead and wounded. Hancock indignantly denied
that we had asked for a truce, as we claimed the ground, stating
that, through the whole day, we had been removing and ministering
to both Union and Rebel wounded. He suggested a cessation of
sharp-shooting until this work could be completed. Pryor declined
this, and in ten minutes the firing reopened.</p>

<p>"A great victory," said Wellington, "is the most awful thing in
the world, except a great defeat." Antietam, though not an entire
victory, had all its terrific features. Our casualties footed up
to twelve thousand three hundred and fifty-two, of whom about two
thousand were killed on the field.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Down Among the Dead Men.</div>

<p>Between the fences of a road immediately beyond the corn-field, in
a space one hundred yards long, I counted more than two hundred
Rebel dead, lying where they fell. Elsewhere, over many acres, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
were strewn singly, in groups, and occasionally in masses, piled
up almost like cord-wood. They were lying&mdash;some with the human form
undistinguishable, others with no outward indication of wounds&mdash;in
all the strange positions of violent death. All had blackened faces.
There were forms with every rigid muscle strained in fierce agony,
and those with hands folded peacefully upon the bosom; some still
clutching their guns, others with arm upraised, and one with a single
open finger pointing to heaven. Several remained hanging over a fence
which they were climbing when the fatal shot struck them.</p>

<p>It was several days before all the wounded were removed from the
field. Many were shockingly mutilated; but the most revolting
spectacle I saw was that of a soldier, with three fingers cut off by
a bullet, leaving ragged, bloody shreds of flesh.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lee Permitted to Escape.</div>

<p>On Thursday night the sun went down with the opposing forces face
to face, and their pickets within stone's throw of each other. On
Friday morning the Rebel army was in Virginia, the National army in
Maryland. Between dark and daylight, Lee evacuated the position, and
carried his whole army across the river. He had no empty breastworks
with which to endow us; but he left a field plowed with shot,
watered with blood, and sown thick with dead. We found the <span
lang="fr">d&eacute;bris</span> of his late camps, two disabled pieces
of artillery, a few hundred of his stragglers, two thousand of his
wounded, and as many more of his unburied dead; but not a single
field-piece or caisson, ambulance or wagon, not a tent, a box of
stores, or a pound of ammunition. He carried with him the supplies
gathered in Maryland and the rich spoils of Harper's Ferry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The John Brown Engine-House.</div>

<p class="quotdate">
   <span class="smcap">Bolivar Hights, Md.</span>, <i>September 25, 1862</i>.
</p>

<p>Adieu to western Maryland, with the stanch loyalty of its suffering
people! Adieu to Sharpsburg, which, cut to pieces by our own shot
and shell as no other village in America ever was, gave us the warm
welcome that comes from the heart! Adieu to the drenched field of
Antietam, with its glorious Wednesday, writing for our army a record
than which nothing brighter shines through history; with its fatal
Thursday, permitting the clean, leisurely escape of the foe down
into the valley, across the difficult ford, and up the Virginia
Hights! Our army might have been driven back; it could never have
been captured or cut to pieces. Failure was only repulse; success was
crowning, decisive, final victory. The enemy saw this, and walked
undisturbed out of the snare.</p>

<p>Three days ago, our army moved down the left bank of the Potomac,
climbing the narrow, tortuous road that winds around the foot of
the mountains; under Maryland Hights; across the long, crooked ford
above the blackened timbers of the railroad bridge; then up among
the long, bare, deserted walls of the ruined Government Armory, past
the engine-house which Old John Brown made historic; up through the
dingy, antique, oriental looking town of Harper's Ferry, sadly worn,
almost washed away by the ebb and flow of war; up through the village
of Bolivar to these Hights, where we pitched our tents.</p>

<p>Behind and below us rushed the gleaming river, till its dark, shining
surface was broken by rocks. Across it came a line of our stragglers,
wading to the knees with staggering steps. Beyond it, the broad
forest-clad Maryland Hights rose gloomy and somber. Down behind me,
to the river, winding across it like a slender S, then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
extending for half a mile on the other side, far up along the
Maryland hill, stretched a division-train of snowy wagons, standing
out in strong relief from the dark background of water and
mountain.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago shots exchanged between the army of Slavery and the
army of Freedom shrieked and screamed over the engine-house, where,
for two days, Old John Brown held the State of Virginia at bay. A
week ago its walls were again shaken by the thunders of cannonade,
when the armies met in fruitless battle. Last night, within
rifle-shot of it, the President's Proclamation of Emancipation was
heard gladly among thirty thousand soldiers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">President Lincoln Reviews the Army.</div>

<p class="quotdate"><i>October 2.</i></p>

<p>President Lincoln arrived here yesterday, and reviewed the troops,
accompanied by McClellan, Sumner, Hancock, Meagher, and other
generals. He appeared in black, wearing a silk hat; and his tall,
slender form, and plain clothing, contrasted strangely with the broad
shoulders and the blue and gold of the major-general commanding.</p>

<p>He is unusually thin and silent, and looks weary and careworn. He
regarded the old engine-house with great interest. It reminded
him, he said, of the Illinois custom of naming locomotives after
fleet animals, such as the "Reindeer," the "Antelope," the "Flying
Dutchman," etc. At the time of the John Brown raid, a new locomotive
was named the "Scared Virginians."</p>

<p>The troops everywhere cheered him with warm enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The cavalry raid of the Rebel General Stuart, around our entire
army, into Maryland and Pennsylvania, and back again, crossing the
Potomac without serious loss, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
the one theme of conversation. It was audacious and brilliant. On his
return, Stuart passed within five miles of McClellan's head-quarters,
which were separated from the rest of the troops by half a mile, and
guarded only by a New York regiment. Some of the staff officers are
very indignant when they are told that Stuart knew the interest of
the Rebels too well to capture our commander.</p>

   <span class="smcap">Charlestown, Virginia</span>, <i>October 16</i>.
</p>

<p>A reconnoissance to the front, commanded by General Hancock. The
column moved briskly over the broad turnpike, through ample fields
rich with shocks of corn, past stately farm-houses, with deep
shade-trees and orchards, by gray barns, surrounded by hay and grain
stacks&mdash;beyond our lines, over the debatable ground, past the Rebel
picket-stations, in sight of Charlestown, and yet no enemy appeared.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dodging Rebel Cannon-Balls.</div>

<p>We began to think Confederates a myth. But suddenly a gun belched
forth in front of us; another, and yet another, and rifled shot came
singing by, cutting through the tree-branches with sharp, incisive
music.</p>

<p>Two of our batteries instantly unlimbered, and replied. Our column
filled the road. Nearly all the Rebel missiles struck in an
apple-orchard within twenty yards of the turnpike; but our men would
persist in climbing the trees and gathering the fruit, in spite of
the shrieking shells.</p>

<p>I have not yet learned to avoid bowing my head instinctively as
a shot screams by; but some old stagers sit perfectly erect, and
laughingly remind me of Napoleon's remark to a young officer: "My
friend, if that shell were really your fate, it would hit you and
kill you if you were a hundred feet underground."</p>

<p>We could plainly see the Rebel cavalry. Far in advance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
of all others, was a rider on a milk-white horse, which made him
a conspicuous mark. The sharpshooters tried in vain to pick him
off, while he sat viewing the artillery drill as complacently as if
enjoying a pantomime. Some of our officers declare that they have
seen that identical steed and rider on the Rebel front in every fight
from Yorktown to Antietam.</p>

<p>After an artillery fire of an hour, in which we lost eight or ten
men, the Rebels evacuated Charlestown, and we entered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"His Soul is Marching On."</div>

<p>The troops take a very keen interest in every thing connected with
the historic old man, who, two years ago, yielded up his life in a
field which is near our camp. They visit it by hundreds, and pour
into the court-house, now open and deserted, where he was tried, and
made that wonderful speech which will never die. They scan closely
the jail, where he wrote and spoke so many electric words. As our
column passed it, one countenance only was visible within&mdash;that of
a negro, looking through a grated window. How his dusky face lit up
behind its prison-bars at the sight of our column, and the words&mdash;</p>

<p>Our pickets descried a solitary horseman, with a basket on his arm,
jogging soberly toward them. He proved a dark mulatto of about
thirty-five, and halted at their order.</p>

<p>"Where are you from?"</p>

<p>"Southern army, Cap'n."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"Goin' to you'se all."</p>

<p>"What do you want?" </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>"Protection, boss. You won't send me back, will you?"</p>

<p>"No, come in. Whose servant are you?"</p>

<p>"Cap'n Rhett's, of South Caroliny. You'se heard of Mr. Barnwell
Rhett, Editor of <cite>The Charleston Mercury</cite>; Cap'n is his
brother, and commands a battery."</p>

<p>"How did you get away?"</p>

<p>"Cap'n gave me fifteen dollars this morning. He said: 'John, go out
and forage for butter and eggs.' So you see, boss" (with a broad
grin), "I'se out foraging. I pulled my hat over my eyes, and jogged
along on the cap'n's horse, with this basket on my arm, right by our
pickets. They never challenged me once. If they had I should have
shown them this."</p>

<p>And he produced from his pocket an order in pencil from Captain Rhett
to pass his servant John, on horseback, in search of butter and eggs.</p>

<p>"Why did you expect protection?"</p>

<p>"Heard so in Maryland, before the Proclamation."</p>

<p>"What do you know about the Proclamation?"</p>

<p>"Read it, sir, in a Richmond paper."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"That every slave is to be emancipated after the first day of next
January. Isn't that it, boss?"</p>

<p>"Something like it. How did you learn to read?"</p>

<p>"A New York lady stopping at the hotel taught me."</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear of Old John Brown?"</p>

<p>"Hear of him! Lord bless you, yes; I've his life now in my trunk in
Charleston. I've read it to heaps of colored folks. They think John
Brown was almost a god. Just say you are a friend of his, and any
slave will kiss your feet, if you will let him. They think, if he
was only alive now, he would be king. How he did frighten the white
folks! It was Sunday morning. I was waiter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
at the Mills House, in Charleston. A lady from Massachusetts
breakfasted at my table. 'John,' she says, 'I want to see a negro
church. Where is the best one?' 'Not any open to-day, Missus,' I told
her. 'Why not?' 'Because a Mr. John Brown has raised an insurrection
in Virginny, and they don't let the negroes go into the street
to-day.' 'Well,' she says, 'they had better look out, or they will
get their white churches shut up, too, one of these days.'"</p>

<div class="sidenote">"The Lord Bless You, General!"</div>

<p>This truly intelligent contraband, being taken to McClellan, replied
very modestly and intelligently to questions about the numbers and
organization of the Rebel army. At the close of the interview, he
asked anxiously:</p>

<p>"General, you won't send me back, will you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied McClellan, with a smile, "I believe I will."</p>

<p>"I hope you won't, General" (with great earnestness). "I come to
you'se all for protection, and I hope you won't."</p>

<p>"Well, then, John, you are at liberty to stay with the army, if you
like, or to go where you please. No one can ever make you a slave
again."</p>

<p>"May the Lord bless you, General! I thought you wouldn't drive me
out. You'se the best friend I ever had. I shall never forget you till

<p>Half way up the mountain, you rest your panting horse at a battery,
among bottle-shaped Dahlgrens, sure at thirty-five hundred yards,
and capable at their utmost elevation of a range of three miles
and a half; black, solemn Parrotts, with iron-banded breech, and
shining howitzers of brass. Far up, accessible only to footmen, is
a long breast-work, where two of our companies repulsed a Rebel
regiment. How high the tide of war must run, when its waves wash this
mountain-top! Here, on the extreme summit, is an open tent of the
Signal-Corps. It is labeled:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Don't touch the instruments. Ask no questions.</span>"</p>

<p>Inside, two operators are gazing at the distant hights, through fixed
telescopes, calling out, "45," "169," "81," etc., which the clerk
records. Each number represents a letter, syllable, or abbreviated
word.</p>

<p>Looking through the long glass toward one of the seven
signal-stations, from four to twenty miles away, communicating with
this, you see a flag, with some large black figure upon a white
foreground. It rises; so many waves to the right; so many to the
left. Then a different flag takes its place, and rises and falls in
turn.</p>

<p>By these combinations, from one to three words per minute are
telegraphed. The operator slowly reads the distant signal to you:
"Two&mdash; hundred&mdash; Rebel&mdash;

field-piece&mdash; on&mdash;road," and it occupies five minutes. Five miles is
an easy distance to communicate, but messages can be sent twenty
miles. The Signal-Corps keep on the front; their services are of
great value. Several of the members have been wounded and some killed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beautiful View from Maryland Hights.</div>

<p>You are on the highest point of the Blue Ridge, four thousand feet
above the sea, one thousand above the Potomac.</p>

<p>Along the path by which you came, climbs a pony; on the pony's back
a negro; on the negro's head a bucket of water; then a mule, bearing
a coffee-sack, containing at each end a keg of water. Thus all
provisions are brought up. Here, in the early morning, you could only
look out upon a cold, shoreless sea of white fog. Now, you look down
upon all the country within a radius of twenty miles, as you would
gaze into your garden from your own house-top.</p>

<p>You see the Potomac winding far away in a thread of silver, broken
by shrubs, rocks, and islands. At your feet lies Pleasant Valley, a
great furrow&mdash;two miles across, from edge to edge&mdash;plowed through
the mountains. It is full of camps, white villages of tents, and
black groups of guns. You see cozy dwellings, with great, well-filled
barns, red brick mills, straw-colored fields dotted with shocks
of corn and reaching far up into the dark, hill-side woods, green
sward-fields, mottled with orchards, and a little shining stream. A
dim haze rests upon the mountain-guarded picture, and the soft wind
seems to sing with Whittier:</p>

command of the army. There stands Burnside, the favorite of the
troops, in blue shirt, knit jacket, and riding-boots, with frank,
manly face, and full, laughing eyes.</p>

<p>Under your feet are Bolivar Hights, crowned with the tents of Couch's
Corps&mdash;dingy by reason of long service, like a Spring snow-drift
through which the dirt begins to sift. You see the quaint old
village of Harper's Ferry, and glimpses of the Potomac&mdash;gold in the
sunset&mdash;with trees and rocks mirrored in its mellow face.</p>

<div class="sidenote">On the March Southward.</div>

<p>When the army left Harper's Ferry, on a forced march, it moved, with
incredible celerity, thirty miles in nine days!</p>

<p>The Virginians east of the Blue Ridge were nearly all hot
Secessionists. The troops, who had behaved well among the Union
people of Maryland, saw the contrast, and spoiled the Egyptians
accordingly. I think if Pharaoh had seen his homestead passed over by
a hungry, hostile force, he would have let the people go.</p>

<p>In the presence of the army, many professed a sort of loyal
neutrality, or neutral loyalty; but I did not hear a single white
Virginian of either sex claim to be an unconditional Unionist.</p>

<p>At Woodgrove, one evening, finding that we should not go into camp
before midnight, I sought supper and lodging at a private house of
the better class. My middle-aged host and his two young, unmarried
sisters, were glad to entertain some one from the army, to protect
their dwelling against stragglers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rebel Girl with a Sharp Tongue.</div>

<p>The elder girl, of about eighteen, was almost a monomaniac upon the
war. She declared she had no aspiration for heaven, if any Yankees
were to be there. She would be proud to kiss the dirtiest, raggedest
soldier in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
the Rebel army. I refrained from discussing politics with
her, and we talked of other subjects.</p>

<p>During the evening, Generals Gorman and Burns reached the house
to seek shelter for the night. The officers, discovering the
sensitiveness of the poor girl, expressed the most ultra sentiments.
Well educated, and with a tongue like a rapier, she was at times
greatly excited, and the blood crimsoned her face; but she out-talked
them all.</p>

<p>"By-the-way," asked Burns, mischievously, "do you ever read <cite>The
Tribune</cite>?"</p>

<p>She replied, with intense indignation:</p>

<p>"Read it! I would not touch it with a pair of tongs! It is the most
infamous Abolition, negro-equality sheet in the whole world!"</p>

<p>"So a great many people say," continued Burns. "However, here is one
of its correspondents."</p>

<p>"In this room?"</p>

<p>"Yes, madam."</p>

<p>"He must be even worse than you, who come down here to murder us!
Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Sitting in the corner there, reading letters."</p>

<p>"I thought you were deceiving me. That is no <cite>Tribune</cite>
correspondent. I do not believe you." (To me:) "This Yankee officer
says that you write for <cite>The New York Tribune</cite>. You don't,
do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, madam."</p>

<p>"Why, you seem to be a gentleman. It is not true! It's a jest between
you just to make me angry.<del>'</del><ins>"</ins></p>

<p>At last convinced, she withheld altogether from me the expected
vituperation, but assailed Burns in a style which made him very glad
to abandon the unequal contest. She relentlessly persisted that he
should always wear his star, for nobody would suspect him of being a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
general if he appeared without his uniform&mdash;that he was the
worst type of the most obnoxious Yankee, etc.</p>

<p>At Upperville, the next day, I inquired of a woman who was
scrutinizing us from her door:</p>

<p>"Have you seen any Rebel pickets this morning?"</p>

<p>She replied, indignantly:</p>

<p>"No! Why do you call them Rebels?"</p>

<p>"As you please, madam; what do you call them?"</p>

<p>"I call them Southern heroes, sir!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Negroes "Watching and Waiting."</div>

<p>The negroes poured into our lines whenever permitted.</p>

<p>"Well, Uncle," I asked of a white-haired patriarch, who was tottering
along the road, "are you a Rebel, like everybody else?"</p>

<p>"No, sir! What should I be a Rebel for? I have been wanting to come
to you all a heap of times; but I just watched and waited."</p>

<p>Watching and waiting! Four millions of negroes were watching and
waiting from the beginning of the war until President Lincoln's
Proclamation.</p>

<p>On the march, Major O'Neil, of General Meagher's staff, started
with a message to Burnside, who was a few miles on our left.
Unsuspectingly, he rode right into a squad of cavalry dressed in
United States uniform. He found that they were Stuart's Rebels in
disguise, and that he was a captive. O'Neil had only just been
exchanged from Libby Prison, and his prospect was disheartening. The
delighted Rebels sent him to their head-quarters in Bloomfield, under
guard of a lieutenant and two men. But, on reaching the village, they
found the head-quarters closed.</p>

<p>"I wonder where our forces are gone," said the Rebel officer. "Oh,
here they are! Men, guard the prisoner while I ride to them."</p>

<p>And he galloped down the street to a company of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
approaching cavalry. Just as he reached them, they leveled their
carbines, and cried:</p>

<p>"Surrender!"</p>

<p>He had made precisely the same mistake as Major O'Neil, and ridden
into our cavalry instead of his own. So, after spending three hours
in the hands of the Rebels, O'Neil found himself once more in our
lines, accompanied by three Rebel prisoners.</p>

<p>The slaveholders complained greatly of the depredations of our army.
A very wealthy planter, who had lost nothing of much value, drew for
me a frightful picture of impending starvation.</p>

<p>"I could bear it myself," exclaimed this Virginian Pecksniff, "but it
is very hard for these little negroes, who are almost as dear to me
as my own children."</p>

<p>He had one of the young Africans upon his knee, and it was quite as
white as "his own children," who were running about the room. The
only perceptible difference was that its hair was curly, while theirs
was straight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Removal of General McClellan.</div>

<p>At Warrenton, on the 7th of November, McClellan was relieved from the
command of the Army of the Potomac. He issued the following farewell:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"An order from the President devolves upon Major-General Burnside
   the command of this army. In parting from you, I cannot express the
   love and gratitude I bear you. As an army, you have grown under my
   care; in you I have never found doubt or coldness. The battles you
   have fought under my command will brightly live in our nation's
   history; the glory you have achieved, our mutual perils and fatigues,
   the graves of our comrades fallen in battle and by disease, the
   broken forms of those whom wounds and sickness have disabled, make
   the strongest associations which can exist among men. United still
   by an indissoluble tie, we shall ever be comrades in supporting the
   Constitution of our country and the nationality of its people."</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<p>McClellan's political and personal friends were aggrieved
and indignant at his removal in the midst of a campaign. Three
of his staff officers even made a foolish attempt to assault a
<cite>Tribune</cite> correspondent, on account of the supposed
hostility of that journal toward their commander. General McClellan,
upon hearing of it, sent a disclaimer and apology, and the officers
were soon heartily ashamed.</p>

<p>The withdrawal was worked up to its utmost dramatic effect.
Immediately after reading the farewell order to all the troops, there
was a final review, in which the outgoing and incoming generals,
with their long staffs, rode along the lines. Salutes were fired and
colors dipped. At some points, the men cheered warmly, but the new
regiments were "heroically reticent." McClellan's chief strength was
with the rank and file.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pickets Talking Across the River.</div>

<p>Burnside pushed the army rapidly forward to the Rappahannock. The
Rebels held Fredericksburg, on the south bank. The men conversed
freely across the stream. One day I heard a dialogue like this:</p>

<p>"Halloo, butternut!"</p>

<p>"Halloo, bluebelly!"</p>

<p>"What was the matter with your battery, Tuesday night?"</p>

<p>"You made it too hot. Your shots drove away the cannoneers, and they
haven't stopped running yet. We infantry men had to come out and
withdraw the guns."</p>

<p>"You infantrymen will run, too, one of these fine mornings."</p>

<p>"When are you coming over?"</p>

<p>"When we get ready to come."</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>"Want Fredericksburg."</p>

<p>"Don't you wish you may get it?" </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p>Here an officer came up and ordered our men away.</p>

<p>The army halted for some weeks in front of Fredericksburg.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How Army Correspondents Lived.</div>

<p>By this time, War Correspondence was employing hundreds of pens.
<cite>The Tribune</cite> had from five to eight men in the Army
of the Potomac, and twelve west of the Alleghanies. My own local
habitation was the head-quarters of Major-General O. O. Howard, who
afterward won wide reputation in Tennessee and Georgia, and who is an
officer of great skill, bravery, and personal purity.</p>

<p>My dispatches were usually prepared, and those of my associates sent
to me, at night. Before dawn, a special messenger called at my tent
for them, and bore them on horseback, or by railway and steamer,
to Washington, whence they were forwarded to New York by mail or
telegraph.</p>

<p>Correspondents usually lived at the head-quarters of some general
officer, bearing their due proportion of mess expenditures; but they
were compelled to rely upon the bounty of quartermasters for forage
for their horses, and transportation for their baggage.</p>

<p>Having no legal and recognized positions in the army, they were
sometimes liable to supercilious treatment from young members
of staff. They were sure of politeness and consideration from
generals; yet, particularly in the regular army, there was a
certain impression that they deserved Halleck's characterization of
"unauthorized hangers-on." To encourage the best class of journalists
to accompany the army, there should be a law distinctly authorizing
representatives of the Press, who are engaged in no other pursuit, to
accompany troops in the field, and purchase forage and provisions at
the same rates as officers. They should, of course, be held to a just
responsibility
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
not to publish information which could benefit the enemy.</p>

<p>Nightly, around our great division camp-fire, negroes of all ages
pored over their spelling-books with commendable thirst for learning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">I'd rather be Free.</div>

<p>One boy, of fourteen, was considered peculiarly stupid, and had
seen hard work, rough living, and no pay, during his twelve months'
sojourn with the army. I asked him: "Did you work as hard for your
old master as you do here?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Did he treat you kindly?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Were you as well clothed as now?"</p>

<p>"Better, sir."</p>

<p>"And had more comforts?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; always had a roof over me, and was never exposed to rain
and cold."</p>

<p>"Would you not have done better to stay at home?"</p>

<p>"If I had thought so, I should not have come away, sir."</p>

<p>"Would you come again, knowing what hardships were before you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I'd rather be free!"</p>

<p>He was not stupid enough to be devoid of human instinct!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Battle of Fredericksburg.</div>

<p>In December occurred the battle of Fredericksburg. The enemy's
position was very strong&mdash;almost impregnable. Our men were
compelled to lay their pontoons across the river in a pitiless rain
of bullets from the Rebel sharpshooters. But they did it without
flinching. Our troops, rank, file, and officers, marched into the
jaws of death with stubborn determination.</p>

<p>We attacked in three columns; but the original design
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
was that the main assault should be on our left, which was commanded
by General Franklin. A road which Franklin wished to reach would
enable him to come up in the rear of Fredericksburg, and compel the
enemy to evacuate his strong works, or be captured. Franklin was very
late in starting. He penetrated once to this road, but did not know
it, and again fell back. Thus the key to the position was lost.</p>

<p>In the center, our troops were flung upon very strong works, and
repulsed with terrible slaughter. It proved a massacre rather than a
battle. Our killed and wounded exceeded ten thousand.</p>

<p>I was not present at the battle, but returned to the army two or
three days after. Burnside deported himself with rare fitness
and magnanimity. As he spoke to me about the brave men who had
fruitlessly fallen, there were tears in his eyes, and his voice broke
with emotion. When I asked him if Franklin's slowness was responsible
for the slaughter, he replied:</p>

<p>"No. I understand perfectly well that when the general commanding an
army meets with disaster, he alone is responsible, and I will not
attempt to shift that responsibility upon any one else. No one will
ever know how near we came to a great victory. It almost seems to me
now that I could have led my old Ninth Corps into those works."</p>

<p>Indeed, Burnside had desired to do this, but was dissuaded by his
lieutenants. The Ninth Corps would have followed him anywhere; but
that would have been certain death.</p>

<p>Burnside was, at least, great in his earnestness, his moral
courage, and perfect integrity. The battle was better than
squandering precious lives in fevers and dysentery during months of
inaction. Better a soldier's death on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
the enemy's guns than a nameless grave in the swamps of the
Chickahominy or the trenches before Corinth.</p>

<p>Ordered to move, Burnside obeyed without quibbling or hesitating,
and flung his army upon the Rebels. The result was defeat; but that
policy proved our salvation at last; by that sign we conquered.</p>

<p>Every private soldier knew that the battle of Fredericksburg was a
costly and bloody mistake, and yet I think on the day or the week
following it, the soldiers would have gone into battle just as
cheerfully and sturdily as before. The more I saw of the Army of
the Potomac, the more I wondered at its invincible spirit, which no
disasters seemed able to destroy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Curious Blunder of the Telegraph.</div>

<p>In January, among the lookers-on in Virginia, was the Hon. Henry
J. Raymond, of <cite>The Times</cite>. He had a brother in the
service, and one day he received this telegram:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"Your brother's corpse is at Belle Plain."</p>
</div>

<p>Hastening to the army as fast as steam could carry him, to perform
the last sad offices of affection, he found his relative not only
living, but in vigorous health. Through the eccentricities of the
telegraph, the word <em>corps</em> had been changed into <em>corpse</em>.</p>

<p>On the 22d of January, Burnside attempted another advance,
designing to cross the Rappahannock in three columns. The weather for
a long time had been fine, but, a few hours after the army started,
the heavens opened, and converted the Virginia roads into almost
fathomless mire. Advance seemed out of the question, and in two days
the troops came back to camp. The Rebels understood the cause, and
prepared an enormous sign, which they erected on their side of the
river, in full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
view of our pickets, bearing the inscription,
"<span class="smcap">Stuck in the mud!</span>"</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Batteries at Fredericksburg.</div>

<p class="quotdate">

</p>

<p>Still on the north bank of the Rappahannock! Upon the high bluffs,
along a line of three miles, twenty-four of our guns point
threateningly toward the enemy. In the ravines behind them a hundred
more wait, ready to be wheeled up and placed in position.</p>

<p>Upon the hills south of the river, distant from them a thousand to
five thousand yards, Rebel guns confront them. Some peer blackly
through hastily-built earthworks; some are just visible over the
crests of sharp ridges; some almost hidden by great piles of brush.
Already we count eighteen; the cannonading will unmask many more.</p>

<div class="poem">

</div>

<p>In front of our right batteries, but far below and hidden from them,
the antique, narrow, half-ruined village of Falmouth hugs the river.
In front of the Rebel batteries, in full view of both sides, the
broad, well-to-do town of Fredericksburg, with its great factories,
tall spires, and brick buildings, is a tempting target for our guns.
The river which flows between (though Fredericksburg is half a mile
below Falmouth), is now so narrow, that a lad can throw a stone
across.</p>

<p>Behind our batteries and their protecting hills rests the
infantry of the Grand Division. General Couch's corps occupies a
crescent-shaped valley&mdash;a symmetric natural amphitheater. It is
all aglow nightly with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
thousand camp-fires; and, from the proscenium-hill of General
Howard's head-quarters, forms a picture mocking all earthly canvas.
Behind the Rebel batteries, in the dense forest, their infantry
occupies a line five miles long. By night we just detect the glimmer
of their fires; by day we see the tall, slender columns of smoke
curling up from their camps.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Disappointed Virginian.</div>

<p>All the citizens ask to have guards placed over their houses; but
very few obtain them. "I will give no man a guard," replied General
Howard to one of these applicants, "until he is willing to lose as
much as I have lost, in defending the Government." The Virginian cast
one long, lingering look at the General's loose, empty coat-sleeve
(he lost his right arm while leading his brigade at Fair Oaks), and
went away, the picture of despair.</p>

<p class="quotdate"><span class="smcap">Army of Potomac</span>, <i>Sunday, Dec. 21</i>.</p>

<p>The general tone of the army is good; far better than could be
expected. There is regret for our failure, sympathy for our wounded,
mourning for our honored dead; but I find little discouragement and
no demoralization.</p>

<p>This is largely owing to the splendid conduct of all our troops. The
men are hopeful because there are few of the usual jealousies and
heart-burnings. No one is able to say, "If this division had not
broken," or "if that regiment had done its duty, we might have won."
The concurrence of testimony is universal, that our men in every
division did better than they ever did before, and made good their
claim to being the best troops in the world. We have had victories
without merit, but this was a defeat without dishonor.</p>

<p>In many respects&mdash;in all respects but the failure of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
its vital
object&mdash;the battle of Fredericksburg was the finest thing of the
war. Laying the bridge, pushing the army across, after the defeat
withdrawing it successfully&mdash;all were splendidly done, and redound
alike to the skill of the general and the heroism of the troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Honor to the Brave and Bold.</div>

<p>And those men and officers of the Seventh Michigan, the Nineteenth
and Twentieth Massachusetts, and the Eighty-ninth New York, who
eagerly crossed the river in open boats, in the teeth of that
pitiless rain of bullets, and dislodged the sharpshooters who were
holding our whole army at bay&mdash;what shall we say of them? Let the
name of every man of them be secured now, and preserved in a roll of
honor; let Congress see to it that, by medal or ribbon to each, the
Republic gives token of gratitude to all who do such royal deeds in
its defense. To the living, at least, we can be just. The fallen,
who were left by hundreds in line of battle, "dead on the field of
honor," we cannot reward; but He who permits no sparrow to fall to
the ground unheeded, will see to it that no drop of their precious
blood has been shed in vain. </p>

<div class="sidenote">Reminiscences of Abraham Lincoln.</div>

<p>The assassination of President Lincoln, while these chapters are
in press, attaches a sad interest to everything connected with his
memory.</p>

<p>During the great canvass for the United States Senate, between
Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Douglas<del>s</del>, the right of Congress to
exclude Slavery from the Territories was the chief point in dispute.
Kansas was the only region to which it had any practical application;
and we, who were residing there, read the debates with peculiar
interest.</p>

<p>No such war of intellects, on the rostrum, was ever witnessed
in America. Entirely without general culture, more ignorant of
books than any other public man of his day, Douglas<del>s</del> was
christened "the Little Giant" by the unerring popular instinct. He
who, without the learning of the schools, and without preparation,
could cope with Webster, Seward, and Sumner, surely deserved that
appellation. He despised study. Rising after one of Mr. Sumner's
most scholarly and elaborate speeches, he said: "Mr. President, this
is very elegant and able, but we all know perfectly well that the
Massachusetts Senator has been rehearsing it every night for a month,
before a looking-glass, with a negro holding a candle!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">His Great Canvass with Douglas<del>s</del>.</div>

<p>Douglas<del>s</del> was, beyond all cotemporaries, a man of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
people. Lincoln, too, was distinctively of the masses; but he
represented their sober, second thought, their higher aspirations,
their better possibilities. Douglas<del>s</del> embodied their
average impulses, both good and bad. Upon the stump, his fluency, his
hard common sense, and his wonderful voice, which could thunder like
the cataract, or whisper with the breeze, enabled him to sway them at
his will.</p>

<p>Hitherto invincible at home, he now found a foeman worthy of his
steel. All over the country people began to ask about this "Honest
Abe Lincoln," whose inexhaustible anecdotes were so droll, yet
so exactly to the point; whose logic was so irresistible; whose
modesty, fairness, and personal integrity, won golden opinions from
his political enemies; who, without "trimming," enjoyed the support
of the many-headed Opposition in Illinois, from the Abolition Owen
Lovejoys of the northern counties, down to the "conservative" old
Whigs of the Egyptian districts, who still believed in the divinity
of Slavery.</p>

<p>Those who did not witness it will never comprehend the universal
and intense horror at every thing looking toward "negro equality"
which then prevailed in southern Illinois. Republican politicians
succumbed to it. In their journals and platforms they sometimes
said distinctly: "We care nothing for the negro. We advocate his
exclusion from our State. We oppose Slavery in the Territories
only because it is a curse to the white man." Mr. Lincoln never
descended to this level. In his plain, moderate, conciliatory way,
he would urge upon his simple auditors that this matter had a Right
and a Wrong&mdash;that the great Declaration of their fathers meant
something. And&mdash;always his strong point&mdash;he would put this
so clearly to the common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
apprehension, and so touch the people's moral sense, that
his opponents found their old cries of "Abolitionist" and
"Negro-worshiper" hollow and powerless.</p>

<p>His defeat, by a very slight majority, proved victory in disguise.
The debates gave him a National reputation. Republican executive
committees in other States issued verbatim reports of the speeches of
both Douglas<del>s</del> and Lincoln, bound up together in the order
of their delivery. They printed them just as they stood, without one
word of comment, as the most convincing plea for their cause. Rarely,
if ever, has any man received so high a compliment as was thus paid
to Mr. Lincoln.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His Visit to Kansas.</div>

<p>In Kansas his stories began to stick like chestnut-burrs in the
popular ear&mdash;to pass from mouth to mouth, and from cabin to cabin.
The young lawyers, physicians, and other politicians who swarm
in the new country, began to quote from his arguments in their
public speeches, and to regard him as the special champion of their
political faith.</p>

<p>Late in the Autumn of 1859 he visited the Territory for the first and
last time. With Marcus J. Parrott, Delegate in Congress, A. Carter
Wilder, afterward Representative, and Henry Villard, a Journalist,
I went to Troy, in Doniphan County, to hear him. In the imaginative
language of the frontier, Troy was a "town"&mdash;possibly a city. But,
save a shabby frame court-house, a tavern, and a few shanties, its
urban glories were visible only to the eye of faith. It was intensely
cold. The sweeping prairie wind rocked the crazy buildings, and cut
the faces of travelers like a knife. Mr. Wilder froze his hand during
our ride, and Mr. Lincoln's party arrived wrapped in buffalo-robes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His Manner of Public Speaking.</div>

<p>Not more than forty people assembled in that little, bare-walled
court-house. There was none of the magnetism
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
of a multitude to inspire the long, angular, ungainly orator,
who rose up behind a rough table. With little gesticulation, and
that little ungraceful, he began, not to declaim, but to talk. In
a conversational tone, he argued the question of Slavery in the
Territories, in the language of an average Ohio or New York farmer. I
thought, "If the Illinoisans consider this a great man, their ideas
must be very peculiar."</p>

<p>But in ten or fifteen minutes I was unconsciously and irresistibly
drawn by the clearness and closeness of his argument. Link after
link it was forged and welded like a blacksmith's chain. He made
few assertions, but merely asked questions: "Is not this true? If
you admit that fact, is not this induction correct?" Give him his
premises, and his conclusions were inevitable as death.</p>

<p>His fairness and candor were very noticeable. He ridiculed
nothing, burlesqued nothing, misrepresented nothing. So far from
distorting the views held by Mr. Douglas<del>s</del> and his
adherents, he stated them with more strength probably than any one of
their advocates could have done. Then, very modestly and courteously,
he inquired into their soundness. He was too kind for bitterness, and
too great for vituperation.</p>

<p>His anecdotes, of course, were felicitous and illustrative. He
delineated the tortuous windings of the Democracy upon the Slavery
question, from Thomas Jefferson down to Franklin Pierce. Whenever
he heard a man avow his determination to adhere unswervingly to the
principles of the Democratic party, it reminded him, he said, of
a "little incident" in Illinois. A lad, plowing upon the prairie,
asked his father in what direction he should strike a new furrow. The
parent replied, "Steer for that yoke of oxen standing at the further
end
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
of the field." The father went away, and the lad obeyed. But just as
he started, the oxen started also. He kept steering for them; and
they continued to walk. He followed them entirely around the field,
and came back to the starting-point, having furrowed a circle instead
of a line!</p>

<div class="sidenote">High Praise from an Opponent.</div>

<p>The address lasted for an hour and three-quarters. Neither
rhetorical, graceful, nor eloquent, it was still very fascinating.
The people of the frontier believe profoundly in fair play, and in
hearing both sides. So they now called for an aged ex-Kentuckian, who
was the heaviest slaveholder in the Territory. Responding, he thus
prefaced his remarks:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have heard, during my life, all the ablest public speakers&mdash;all
the eminent statesmen of the past and the present generation. And
while I dissent utterly from the doctrines of this address, and shall
endeavor to refute some of them, candor compels me to say that it is
the most able and the most logical speech I ever listened to."</p>

<p>I have alluded in earlier pages, to remarks touching the reports
that Mr. Lincoln would be assassinated, which I heard in the South,
on the day of his first inauguration. Afterward, in my presence,
several persons of the wealthy, slaveholding class, alluded to the
subject, some having laid wagers upon the event. I heard but one man
condemn the proposed assassination, and he was a Unionist. Again and
again, leading journals, which were called reputable, asked: "Is
there no Brutus to rid the world of this tyrant?" Rewards were openly
proposed for the President's head. If Mr. Lincoln had then been
murdered in Baltimore, every thorough Secession journal in the South
would have expressed its approval, directly or indirectly. Of course,
I do not believe that the masses, or all Secessionists,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
would have desired such a stain upon the American name; but even
then, as afterward, when they murdered our captured soldiers,
and starved, froze, and shot our prisoners, the men who led and
controlled the Rebels appeared deaf to humanity and to decency.
Charity would fain call them insane; but there was too much method in
their madness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Deed without a Name.</div>

<p>Their last, great crime of all was, perhaps, needed for an eternal
monument of the influence of Slavery. It was fitting that they who
murdered Lovejoy, who crimsoned the robes of young Kansas, who aimed
their gigantic Treason at the heart of the Republic, before the
curtain went down, should crown their infamy by this deed without a
name. It was fitting that they should seek the lives of President
Lincoln, General Grant, and Secretary Seward, the three officers most
conspicuous of all for their mildness and clemency. It was fitting
they should assassinate a Chief Magistrate, so conscientious, that
his heavy responsibility weighed him down like a millstone; so pure,
that partisan rancor found no stain upon the hem of his garment; so
gentle, that e'en his failings leaned to virtue's side; so merciful,
that he stood like an averting angel between them and the Nation's
vengeance.</p>

<p>The Rebel newspapers represented him&mdash;a man who used neither spirits
nor tobacco&mdash;as in a state of constant intoxication. They ransacked
the language for epithets. Their chief hatred was called out by his
origin. He illustrated the Democratic Idea, which was inconceivably
repugnant to them. That a man who sprang from the people, worked with
his hands, actually split rails in boyhood, should rise to the head
of a Government which included Southern gentlemen, was bitter beyond
description! </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sherman's Quarrel with the Press.</div>

<p>On the 28th of December, 1862, Sherman fought the battle of Chickasaw
Bayou, one of our first fruitless attempts to capture Vicksburg.
Grant designed to co-operate by an attack from the rear, but his long
supply-line extended to Columbus, Kentucky, though he might have
established a nearer base at Memphis. Van Dorn cut his communications
at Holly Springs, Mississippi, and Grant was compelled to fall back.</p>

<p>Sherman's attack proved a serious disaster. Our forces were flung
upon an almost impregnable bluff, where we lost about two thousand
five hundred men, and were then compelled to retreat.</p>

<p>In the old quarrel between Sherman and the Press, as usual, there was
blame upon both sides. Some of the correspondents had treated him
unjustly; and he had not learned the quiet patience and faith in the
future which Grant exhibited under similar circumstances. At times he
manifested much irritation and morbid sensitiveness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An Army Correspondent Court-martialed.</div>

<p>A well-known correspondent, Mr. Thomas W. Knox, was present at the
battle, and placed his report of it, duly sealed, and addressed to a
private citizen, in the military mail at Sherman's head-quarters. One
"Colonel" A. H. Markland, of Kentucky, United States Postal Agent, on
mere surmise about its contents, took the letter from the mail and
permitted it to be opened. He insisted afterward that he did this by
Sherman's express command. Sherman denied giving any such order, but
said he was satisfied with Markland's course.</p>

<p>Markland should have been arrested for robbing the Government
mails, which he was sworn to protect. There was no reasonable pretext
for asserting that the letter would give information to the enemy;
therefore it did not imperil the public interest. If General Sherman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
deemed it unjust to himself individually, he had his remedy, like
any other citizen or soldier, in the courts of the country and the
justice of the people.</p>

<p>The purloined dispatch was left for four or five days lying about
Sherman's head-quarters, open to the inspection of officers. Finally,
upon Knox's written request, it was returned to him, though a map
which it contained was kept&mdash;as he rather pungently suggested,
probably for the information of the military authorities!</p>

<p>Knox's letter had treated the generalship of the battle very
tenderly. But after this proceeding he immediately forwarded a
second account, which expressed his views on the subject in very
plain English. Its return in print caused great excitement at
head-quarters. Knox was arrested, and tried before a military
tribunal on these charges:&mdash;</p>

<ol class="roman">
   <li>Giving information to the enemy.</li>
   <li>Being a spy.</li>
   <li>Violating the fifty-seventh Article of War, which forbids
   the writing of letters for publication from any United States army
   without submitting them to the commanding general for approval.</li>
</ol>

<p>The court-martial sat for fifteen days. It acquitted Knox upon the
first and second charges. Of course, he was found guilty of the
third. After some hesitation between sentencing him to receive a
written censure, or to leave Grant's department, the latter was
decided upon, and he was banished from the army lines.</p>

<p>When information of this proceeding reached Washington, the
members of the press at once united in a memorial to the President,
asking him to set aside the sentence, inasmuch as the violated
Article of War was altogether obsolete, and the practice of sending
newspaper letters, without any official scrutiny, had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
universal, with the full sanction of the Government, from the outset
of the Rebellion. It was further represented that Mr. Knox was
thoroughly loyal, and the most scrupulously careful of all the army
correspondents to write nothing which, by any possibility, could give
information to the enemy. Colonel John W. Forney headed the memorial,
and all the journalists in Washington signed it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Visit to President Lincoln.</div>

<p>One evening, with Mr. James M. Winchell, of <cite>The New York
Times,</cite> and Mr. H. P. Bennett, Congressional Delegate from
Colorado, I called upon the President to present the paper.</p>

<p>After General Sigel and Representative John B. Steele had left, he
chanced to be quite at liberty. Upon my introduction, he remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I remember you perfectly well: you were out on the
prairies with me on that winter day when we almost froze to death;
you were then correspondent of <cite>The Boston Journal</cite>. That
German from Leavenworth was also with us&mdash;what was his name?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two "Little Stories."</div>

<p>"Hatterscheit?" I suggested. "Yes, Hatterscheit! By-the-way"
(motioning us to seats, and settling down into his chair, with
one leg thrown over the arm), "that reminds me of a little story,
which Hatterscheit told me during the trip. He bought a pony of an
Indian, who could not speak much English, but who, when the bargain
was completed, said: 'Oats&mdash;no! Hay&mdash;no! Corn&mdash;no!
Cottonwood&mdash;yes! very much!' Hatterscheit thought this was mere
drunken maundering; but a few nights after, he tied his horse in
a stable built of cottonwood logs, fed him with hay and corn, and
went quietly to bed. The next morning he found the grain and fodder
untouched, but the barn was quite empty, with a great hole on one
side, which the pony had gnawed his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
way through! Then he comprehended the old Indian's fragmentary
English."</p>

<p>This suggested another reminiscence of the same Western trip.
Somewhere in Nebraska the party came to a little creek, the Indian
name of which signified weeping water. Mr. Lincoln remarked,
with a good deal of aptness, that, as laughing water, according
to Longfellow, was "Minne-haha," the name of this rivulet should
evidently be "Minne-boohoo."</p>

<p>These inevitable preliminaries ended, we presented the memorial
asking the President to interpose in behalf of Mr. Knox. He promptly
answered he would do so if Grant coincided. We reminded him that this
was improbable, as Sherman and Grant were close personal friends.
After a moment's hesitancy he replied, with courtesy, but with
emphasis:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I should be glad to serve you or Mr. Knox, or any other loyal
journalist. But, just at present, our generals in the field are more
important to the country than any of the rest of us, or all the rest
of us. It is my fixed determination to do nothing whatever which can
possibly embarrass any one of them. Therefore, I will do cheerfully
what I have said, but it is all I can do."</p>

<p>There was too much irresistible good sense in this to permit any
further discussion. The President took up his pen and wrote,
reflecting a moment from time to time, the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p class="quotdate"><span class="smcap">Executive Mansion, Washington,</span>
   <i>March 20, 1863</i>.</p>
   <p><em>Whom it may concern</em>:</p>
   <p><em>Whereas</em>, It appears to my satisfaction that Thomas
   W. Knox, a correspondent of <cite>The New York Herald</cite>,
   has been, by the sentence of a court-martial, excluded from the
   military department under command of Major-General Grant, and also
   that General Thayer, president of the court-martial which rendered
   the sentence, and Major-General McClernand, in command of a corps
   of the department, and many other respectable persons, are of the
   opinion that Mr. Knox's offense was technical, rather than wilfully
   wrong, and that the sentence should be revoked; Now, therefore, said
   sentence is hereby so far revoked as to allow Mr. Knox to return
   to General Grant's head-quarters, and to remain if General Grant
   shall give his express assent, and to again leave the department, if
   General Grant shall refuse such assent.</p> <p class="quotsig"><span

<p>Reading it over carefully, he handed it to me, and gave a little sigh
of relief. General conversation ensued. Despondent and weighed down
with his load of care, he sought relief in frank speaking. He said,
with great earnestness: "God knows that I want to do what is wise and
right, but sometimes it is very difficult to determine."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Lincoln's Familiar Conversation.</div>

<p>He conversed freely of military affairs, but suddenly remarked: "I am
talking again! Of course, you will remember that I speak to you only
as friends; that none of this must be put in print."</p>

<p>Touching an attack upon Charleston which had long been contemplated,
he said that Du Pont had promised, some weeks before, if certain
supplies were furnished, to make the assault upon a given day. The
supplies were promptly forwarded; the day came and went without any
intelligence. Some time after, he sent an officer to Washington,
asking for three more iron-clads and a large quantity of deck-plating
as indispensable to the preparations.</p>

<p>"I told the officer to say to Commodore Du Pont," observed Mr.
Lincoln, "that I fear he does not appreciate at all the value of
time."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opinions about McClellan and Vicksburg.</div>

<p>The Army of the Potomac was next spoken of. The great Fredericksburg
disaster was recent, and the public heart was heavy. In regard to
General McClellan, the President spoke with discriminating justice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do not, as some do, regard McClellan either as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
traitor or an officer without capacity. He sometimes has bad
counselors, but he is loyal, and he has some fine military qualities.
I adhered to him after nearly all my Constitutional advisers lost
faith in him. But do you want to know when I gave him up? It was
after the battle of Antietam. The Blue Ridge was then between our
army and Lee's. We enjoyed the great advantage over them which they
usually had over us: we had the short line, and they the long one,
to the Rebel Capital. I directed McClellan peremptorily to move on
Richmond. It was eleven days before he crossed his first man over
the Potomac; it was eleven days after that before he crossed the
last man. Thus he was twenty-two days in passing the river at a
much easier and more practicable ford than that where Lee crossed
his entire army between dark one night and daylight the next
morning. That was the last grain of sand which broke the camel's
back. I relieved McClellan at once. As for Hooker, I have told
<em>him</em> forty times that I fear he may err just as much one way as
McClellan does the other&mdash;may be as over-daring as McClellan is
over-cautious."</p>

<p>We inquired about the progress of the Vicksburg campaign. Our armies
were on a long expedition up the Yazoo River, designing, by digging
canals and threading bayous, to get in the rear of the city and cut
off its supplies. Mr. Lincoln said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of course, men who are in command and on the spot, know a great deal
more than I do. But immediately in front of Vicksburg, where the
river is a mile wide, the Rebels plant batteries, which absolutely
stop our entire fleets. Therefore it does seem to me that upon narrow
streams like the Yazoo, Yallabusha, and Tallahatchie, not wide enough
for a long boat to turn around in, if any of our steamers which go
there ever come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
back, there must be some mistake about it. If the
enemy permits them to survive, it must be either through lack of
enterprise or lack of sense."</p>

<p>A few months later, Mr. Lincoln was able to announce to the nation:
"The Father of Waters again flows unvexed to the sea."</p>

<p>Our interview left no grotesque recollections of the President's
lounging, his huge hands and feet, great mouth, or angular features.
We remembered rather the ineffable tenderness which shone through his
gentle eyes, his childlike ingenuousness, his utter integrity, and
his absorbing love of country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Our Best Contribution To History.</div>

<p>Ignorant of etiquette and conventionalities, without the graces of
form or of manner, his great reluctance to give pain, his beautiful
regard for the feelings of others, made him</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"Worthy to bear without reproach The grand old name of
   Gentleman."</p>
</div>

<p>Strong without symmetry, humorous without levity, religious without
cant&mdash;tender, merciful, forgiving, a profound believer in Divine
love, an earnest worker for human brotherhood&mdash;Abraham Lincoln was
perhaps the best contribution which America has made to History.</p>

<p>His origin among humble laborers, his native judgment, better than
the wisdom of the schools, his perfect integrity, his very ruggedness
and angularities, made him fit representative of the young Nation
which loved and honored him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Noble Life and Happy Death.</div>

<p>No more shall sound above our tumultuous rejoicing his wise caution,
"Let us be very sober." No more shall breathe through the passions
of the hour his tender pleading that judgment may be tempered with
mercy. His work is done. Nothing could have assured and enlarged
his posthumous fame like this tragic ending. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
goes to a place in History where his peers will be very few. The
poor wretch who struck the blow has gone to be judged by infinite
Justice, and also by infinite Mercy. So have many others indirectly
responsible for the murder, and directly responsible for the war.
Let us remember them in no Pharisaic spirit, thanking God that we
are not as other men&mdash;but as warnings of what a race with many
generous and manly traits may become by being guilty of injustice and
oppression.</p>

<p>Some of the President's last expressions were words of mercy for his
enemies. A few hours before his death, in a long interview with his
trusted and honored friend Schuyler Colfax, he stated that he wished
to give the Rebel leaders an opportunity to leave the country and
escape the vengeance which seemed to await them here.</p>

<p>America is never likely to feel again the profound, universal grief
which followed the death of Abraham Lincoln. Even the streets of her
great Metropolis "forgot to roar." Hung were the heavens in black.
For miles, every house was draped in mourning. The least feeling was
manifested by that sham aristocracy, which had the least sympathy
with the Union cause and with the Democratic Idea. The deepest was
displayed by the "plain people" and the poor.</p>

<p>What death is happier than thus to be wept by the lowly and
oppressed, as a friend and protector! What life is nobler than thus
to be filled, in his own golden words, "with charity for all, with
malice toward none!" </p>

<div class="sidenote">Reminiscences of General Sumner.</div>

<p>During the month of March, Major-General Edwin V. Sumner was in
Washington, apparently in vigorous health. He had just been appointed
to the command of the Department of the Missouri. One Saturday
evening, having received his final orders, he was about leaving for
his home in Syracuse, New York, where he designed spending a few days
before starting for St. Louis.</p>

<p>I went into his room to bid him adieu. Allusion was made to the
allegations of speculation against General Curtis, his predecessor
in the West. "I trust," said he, "they are untrue. No general has a
right to make one dollar out of his official position, beyond the
salary which his Government pays him." He talked somewhat in detail
of the future, remarking, "For the present, I shall remain in St.
Louis; but whenever there is a prospect of meeting the enemy, I shall
take the field, and lead my troops in person. Some men can fight
battles over a telegraph-wire, but you know I have no talent in that
direction."</p>

<p>With his friendly grasp of the hand, and his kindly smile, he
started for home. It proved to him Home indeed. A week later the
country was startled by intelligence of his sudden death. He, who
for forty-eight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
years had braved the hardships of campaigning and
the perils of battle, until he seemed to have a charmed life, was
abruptly cut down by disease under his own roof, surrounded by those
he loved.</p>

<div class="poem">
   <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i0">"The breast that trampling Death could spare,</span>
      <span class="i0">His noiseless shafts assail."</span>
   </div>
</div>

<p>For almost half a century, Sumner had belonged to the Army of the
United States; but he steadfastly refused to be put on the retired
list. Entering the service from civil life, he was free from
professional traditions and narrowness. Senator Wade once asked him,
"How long were you at the Military Academy?" He replied, "I was never
there in my life."</p>

<p>The bluff Ohioan sprang up and shook him fervidly by the hand,
exclaiming, "Thank God for one general of the regular Army, who was
never at West Point!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">His Conduct in Kansas.</div>

<p>During the early Kansas troubles, Sumner, then a colonel, was
stationed in the Territory with his regiment of dragoons.
Unscrupulous as were the Administrations of Pierce and Buchanan
in their efforts to force Slavery upon Kansas, embittered as were
the people against the troops,&mdash;generally mere tools of Missouri
ruffians&mdash;their feelings toward Sumner were kindly and grateful. They
knew he was a just man, who would not willingly harass or oppress
them, and who sympathized with them in their fiery trial.</p>

<p>From the outbreak of the Slaveholders' Rebellion his name was one of
the brightest in that noble but unfortunate army which illustrated
Northern discipline and valor on so many bloody fields, but had never
yet gathered the fruits of victory. He was always in the deadliest of
the fighting. He had the true soldierly temperament. He snuffed the
battle afar off. He felt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
"the rapture of the strife," and went into it with boyish enthusiasm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Thrilling Scene in Battle.</div>

<p>In exposing himself, he was Imprudence personified. It was the
chronic wonder of his friends that he ever came out of battle alive.
At last they began to believe, with him, that he was invincible. He
would receive bullets in his hat, coat, boots, saddle, horse, and
sometimes have his person scratched, but without serious injury.
His soldiers related, with great relish, that in the Mexican War
a ball which struck him square in the forehead fell flattened to
the ground without breaking the skin, as the bullet glances from
the forehead of the buffalo. This anecdote won for him the <span
lang="fr">soubriquet</span> of "Old Buffalo."</p>

<p>At Fair Oaks, his troops were trembling under a pitiless storm of
bullets, when he galloped up and down the advance line, more exposed
than any private in the ranks.</p>

<p>"What regiment is this?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The Fifteenth Massachusetts," replied a hundred voices.</p>

<p>"I, too, am from Massachusetts; three cheers for our old Bay State!"
And swinging his hat, the general led off, and every soldier joined
in three thundering cheers. The enemy looked on in wonder at the
strange episode, but was driven back by the fierce charge which
followed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How Sumner Fought.</div>

<p>This was no unusual scene. Whenever the guns began to pound, his mild
eye would flash with fire. He would remove his artificial teeth,
which became troublesome during the excitement of battle, and place
them carefully in his pocket; raise his spectacles from his eyes and
rest them upon the forehead, that he might see clearly objects at a
distance; give his orders to subordinates,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
and then gallop headlong into the thick of the fight.</p>

<p>Hundreds of soldiers were familiar with the erect form, the snowy,
streaming hair, and the frank face of that wonderful old man who,
on the perilous edge of battle, while they were falling like grass
before the mower, would dash through the fire and smoke, shouting:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Steady, men, steady! Don't be excited. When you have been soldiers
as long as I, you will learn that this is nothing. Stand firm and do
your duty!"</p>

<p>Never seeking a dramatic effect, he sometimes displayed quiet heroism
worthy of history's brightest pages. Once, quite unconsciously
reproducing a historic scene, he repeated, almost word for word, the
address of the great Frederick to his officers, before the battle of
Leuthen. It was on the bloody field of Fair Oaks, at the end of the
second day. He commanded the forces which had crossed the swollen
stream. But before the other troops came up, the bridges were swept
away. The army was then cut in twain; and Sumner, with his three
shattered corps, was left to the mercy of the enemy's entire force.</p>

<p>On that Sunday night, after making his dispositions to receive an
attack, he sent for General Sedgwick, his special friend and a most
trusty soldier:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sedgwick, you perceive the situation. The enemy will doubtless open
upon us at daylight. Re-enforcements are impossible; he can overwhelm
and destroy us. But the country cannot afford to have us defeated.
There is just one thing for us to do; we must stand here and die like
men! Impress it upon your officers that we must do this to the last
man&mdash;to the last man! We may not meet again; good-by, Sedgwick."</p>

<p>The two grim soldiers shook hands, and parted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
Morning came, but the enemy, failing to discover our perilous
condition, did not renew the attack; new bridges were built, and
the sacrifice was averted. But Sumner was the man to carry out his
resolution to the letter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ordered Back by McClellan.</div>

<p>Afterward, he retained possession of a house on our old line of
battle; and his head-quarter tents were brought forward and pitched.
They were within range of a Rebel battery, which awoke the general
and his staff every morning, by dropping shot and shell all about
them for two or three hours. Sumner implored permission to capture or
drive away the hostile battery, but was refused, on the ground that
it might bring on a general engagement. He chafed and stormed: "It is
the most disgraceful thing of my life," he said, "that this should
be permitted." But McClellan was inexorable. Sumner was directed
to remove his head-quarters to a safer position. He persisted in
remaining for fourteen days, and at last only withdrew upon a second
peremptory order.</p>

<p>The experience of that fortnight exhibited the ever-recurring miracle
of war&mdash;that so much iron and lead may fly about men's ears without
harming them. During the whole bombardment only two persons were
injured. A surgeon was slightly wounded in the head by a piece of
shell which flew into his tent; and a private, while lying behind
a log for protection, was instantly killed by a shot which tore a
splinter from the wood, fracturing his skull; but not another man
received even a scratch.</p>

<p>After Antietam, McClellan's ever-swift apologists asserted that his
corps commanders all protested against renewing the attack upon the
second morning. I asked General Sumner if it were true. He replied,
with emphasis:&mdash; </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, sir! My advice was not asked, and I did not volunteer it. But I
was certainly in favor of renewing the attack. Much, as my troops had
suffered, they were good for another day's fighting, especially when
the enemy had that river in his rear, and a defeat would have ruined
him forever."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Love for His Old Comrades.</div>

<p>At Fredericksburg, by the express order of Burnside, Sumner did not
cross the river during the fighting. The precaution saved his life.
Had he ridden out on that fiery front, he had never returned to tell
what he saw. But he chafed sadly under the restriction. As the sun
went down on that day of glorious but fruitless endeavor, he paced to
and fro in front of the Lacy House, with one arm thrown around the
neck of his son, his face haggard with sorrow and anxiety, and his
eyes straining eagerly for the arrival of each successive messenger.</p>

<p>He was a man of high but patriotic ambition. Once, hearing General
Howard remark that he did not aspire to the command of a corps, he
exclaimed, "General you surprise me. <em>I</em> would command the world, if
I could!"</p>

<p>He was called arbitrary, but had great love for his soldiers,
especially for old companions in arms. A New York colonel told me a
laughable story of applying to him for a ten days' furlough, when
the rule against them was imperative. Sumner peremptorily refused
it. But the officer sat down beside him, and began to talk about
the Peninsular campaign&mdash;the battles in which he had done his duty,
immediately under Sumner's eye; and it was not many minutes before
the general granted his petition. "If he had only waited," said the
narrator, "until I recalled to his memory some scenes at Antietam, I
am sure he would have given me twenty days instead of ten!"</p>

<p>His intercourse with women and children was characterized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
by peculiar chivalry and gentleness. He revived the old ideal of
the soldier&mdash;terrible in battle, but with an open and generous
heart.</p>

<p>To his youngest son&mdash;a captain upon his staff&mdash;he was
bound by unusual affection. "Sammy" was his constant companion; in
private he leaned upon him, caressed him, and consulted him about the
most trivial matters. It was a touching bond which united the gray,
war-worn veteran to the child of his old age.</p>

<p>We have had greater captains than Sumner; but no better soldiers, no
braver patriots. The words which trembled upon his dying lips&mdash;"May
God bless my country, the United States of America"&mdash;were the
key-note to his life. Green be the turf above him!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Traveling Through the Northwest.</div>

<p class="quotdate"> <span class="smcap">Louisville,
Kentucky</span>, <i>April 5, 1863</i>. </p>

<p>For the last week I have been traveling through the States of the
Northwest. The tone of the people on the war was never better. Now
that the question has become simply one of endurance, their Northern
blood tells. "This is hard pounding, gentlemen," said Wellington
at Waterloo; "but we will see who can pound the longer." So, in
spite of the Copperheads&mdash;"merely the dust and chaff on God's
thrashing-floor"&mdash;the overwhelming sentiment of the people is to
fight it out to the last man and the last dollar.</p>

<p>You have been wont to say: "The West can be depended on for the
war. She will never give up her great outlet, the Mississippi."
True; but the inference that her loyalty is based upon a material
consideration, is untrue and unjust. The West has poured out its best
blood, not on any petty question of navigation, or of trade, but upon
the weightier issues of Freedom and Nationality.</p>

<p>The New-Yorker or Pennsylvanian may believe in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
the greatness of the country; the Kansan or Minnesotian, who has
gone one or two thousand miles to establish his prairie home, walks
by sight and not by faith. To him, the Great Republic of the future
is no rhetorical flourish or flight of fancy, but a living verity.
His instinct of nationality is the very strongest; his belief the
profoundest. May he never need Emerson's pungent criticism: "The
American eagle is good; protect it, cherish it; but beware of the
American peacock!"</p>

<p>Have you heard Prentice's last, upon the bursting of the Rebel bubble
that Cotton is King? He says: "They went in for cotton, and they got
worsted!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Visit to Rosecrans's Army.</div>

<p class="quotdate"> <span class="smcap">Murfreesboro,
Tennessee</span>, <i>April 10</i>. </p>

<p>A visit to Rosecrans's army. I rode yesterday over the historical
battle-ground of Stone River, among rifle-pits and breastworks, great
oaks, with scarred trunks, and tops and branches torn off, and smooth
fields thickly planted with graves.</p>

<p>It is interesting to hear from the soldiers reminiscences of the
battle. Rosecrans may not be strong in planning a campaign, but the
thundering guns rouse him to the exhibition of a higher military
genius than any other general in our service has yet displayed. The
"grand anger of battle" makes him see at a glance the needs of the
occasion, and stimulates those quick intuitions which enable great
captains, at the supreme moment, to wrest victory from the very grasp
of defeat. Peculiarly applicable to him is Addison's description of
Marlborough:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rosecrans in a Great Battle.</div>

<p>During the recent great conflict which began with disaster that would
have caused ordinary generals to retreat, he seemed omnipresent. A
devout Catholic, he performed, before entering the battle, the solemn
rites of his Church. A profound believer in destiny, he appeared like
a man who sought for death. A few feet from him, a solid shot took
off the head of Garasche, his loved and trusted chief of staff.</p>

<p>"Brave men must die," he said, and plunged into the battle again.</p>

<p>He had a word for all. Of an Ohio regiment, lying upon the ground, he
asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Boys, do you see that strip of woods?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, in about five minutes, the Rebels will pour out of it, and
come right toward you. Lie still until you can easily see the buttons
on their coats; then drive them back. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, it's just as easy as rolling off a log, isn't it?"</p>

<p>They laughingly assented, and "Old Rosy," as the soldiers call him,
rode along the line, to encourage some other corps.</p>

<p>This is an army of veterans. Every regiment has been in battle,
and some have marched three thousand miles during their checkered
campaigning. Their garments are old and soiled; but their guns are
bright and glistening, and on review their evolutions are clockwork.
They are splendidly disciplined, of unequaled enthusiasm, full of
faith in their general and in themselves.</p>

<p>Rosecrans is an erect, solid man of one hundred and seventy-five
pounds weight, whose forty-three years sit lightly on his face and
frame. He has a clear, mild-blue eye, which lights and flashes under
excitement; an intensified
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
Roman nose, high cheek-bones, florid complexion, mouth and chin
hidden under dark-brown beard, hair faintly tinged with silver, and
growing thin on the edges of the high, full, but not broad, forehead.
In conversation, a winning, mirthful smile illumines his face. As
Hamlet would take the ghost's word for a thousand pounds, so you
would trust that countenance in a stranger as indicating fidelity,
reserved power, an overflowing humor, and imperious will.</p>

      <p class="citation">Tempest.</p>
   </div>
</div>

<p>On Sunday evening, May 3d, accompanied by Mr. Richard T. Colburn,
of <cite>The New York World</cite>, I reached Milliken's Bend, on
the Mississippi River, twenty-five miles above Vicksburg. Grant's
head-quarters were at Grand Gulf, fifty-five miles below Vicksburg.
Fighting had already begun.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Running the Vicksburg Batteries.</div>

<p>We joined my associate, Mr. Junius H. Browne, of <cite>The Tribune</cite>,
who for several days had been awaiting us. The insatiate hunger of
the people for news, and the strong competition between different
journals, made one day of battle worth a year of camp or siege to the
war correspondent. Duty to the paper we represented required that we
should join the army with the least possible delay.</p>

<p>We could go over land, down the Louisiana shore, and, if we safely
ran the gauntlet of Rebel guerrillas, reach Grand Gulf in three days.
But a little expedition was about to run the Vicksburg batteries.
If it survived the fiery ordeal, it would arrive at Grant's
head-quarters in eight hours. Thus far, three-fourths of the boats
attempting to run the batteries had escaped destruction; and yielding
to the seductive doctrine of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
probabilities, we determined to try the
short, or water route. It proved a very long one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Expedition Badly Fitted Out.</div>

<p>At ten o'clock our expedition started. It consisted of two great
barges of forage and provisions, propelled by a little tug between
them. For some days, Grant had been receiving supplies in this
manner, cheaper and easier than by transportation over rough
Louisiana roads.</p>

<p>The lives of the men who fitted out the squadron being as valuable
to them as mine to me, I supposed that all needful precautions for
safety had been adopted. But, when under way, we learned that they
were altogether inadequate. Indeed, we were hardly on board when we
discovered that the expedition was so carelessly organized as almost
to invite capture.</p>

<p>The night was one of the lightest of the year. We had only two
buckets, and not a single skiff. Two tugs were requisite to steer the
unwieldy craft, and enable us to run twelve or fifteen miles an hour.
With one we could accomplish only seven miles, aided by the strong
Mississippi current.</p>

<p>There were thirty-five persons on board&mdash;all volunteers. They
consisted of the tug's crew, Captain Ward and Surgeon Davidson of the
Forty-Seventh Ohio Infantry, with fourteen enlisted men, designed
to repel possible boarders, and other officers and citizens, <span
lang="fr">en route</span> for the army.</p>

<p>For two or three hours, we glided silently along the glassy waters
between banks festooned with heavy, drooping foliage. It was a scene
of quiet, surpassing beauty. Captain Ward suddenly remembered that
he had some still Catawba in his valise. He was instructed to behead
the bottle with his sword, that the wine might not in any event be
wasted. From a soldier's cup of gutta-percha we drank to the success
of the expedition. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Into the Jaws of Death.</div>

<p>At one o'clock in the morning, on the Mississippi shore, a rocket
shot up and pierced the sky, signaling the Rebels of our approach.
Ten minutes later, we saw the flash and heard the boom of their first
gun. Much practice on similar expeditions had given them excellent
range. The shell struck one of our barges, and exploded upon it.</p>

<p>We were soon under a heavy fire. The range of the batteries covered
the river for nearly seven miles. The Mississippi here is very
crooked, resembling the letter S, and at some points we passed within
two hundred yards of ten-inch guns, with point-blank range upon us.
As we moved around the bends, the shots came toward us at once from
right and left, front and rear.</p>

<p>Inclination had joined with duty in impelling us to accompany the
expedition. We wanted to learn how one would feel looking into the
craters of those volcanoes as they poured forth sheets of flame and
volleys of shells. I ascertained to my fullest satisfaction, as we
lay among the hay-bales, slowly gliding past them. I thought it might
be a good thing to do once, but that, if we survived it, I should
never feel the least desire to repeat the experiment.</p>

<p>We embraced the bales in Bottom's belief that "good hay, sweet hay
hath no fellow."</p>

<p>Discretion was largely the better part of my valor, and I cowered
close in our partial shelter. But two or three times I could not
resist the momentary temptation to rise and look about me. How the
great sheets of flame leaped up and spread out from the mouths of the
guns! How the shells came screaming and shrieking through the air!
How they rattled and crashed, penetrating the sides of the barges, or
exploding on board in great fountains of fire! </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Moment of Suspense.</div>

<p>The moment hardly awakened serene meditations or sentimental
memories; but every time I glanced at that picture, Tennyson's lines
rang in my ears:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Cannon to right of them,</span>
<span class="i0">Cannon to left of them,</span>
<span class="i0">Cannon in front of them</span>
<span class="i6">Volleyed and thundered;</span>
<span class="i0">Stormed at by shot and shell,</span>
<span class="i0">Boldly they rode and well,</span>
<span class="i0">Into the jaws of death,</span>
<span class="i0">Into the mouth of hell</span>
<span class="i6">Rode the six hundred!"</span>
</div></div>

<p>"Junius" persisted in standing, all exposed, to watch the coming
shots. Once, as a shell exploded near at hand, he fell heavily down
among the hay-bales. Until that moment I never knew what suspense
was. I could find no voice in which to ask if he lived. I dared
not put forth my hand in the darkness, lest it should rest on his
mutilated form. At last he spoke, and relieved my anxiety. He had
only slipped and fallen.</p>

<p>Each time, after being struck, we listened for the reassuring puff!
puff! puff! of our little engine; and hearing it, said: "Thus far, at
least, we are all right!"</p>

<p>Now we were below the town, having run five miles of batteries. Ten
minutes more meant safety. Already we began to felicitate each other
upon our good fortune, when the scene suddenly changed.</p>

<p>A terrific report, like the explosion of some vast magazine, left
us breathless, and seemed to shake the earth to its very center. It
was accompanied by a shriek which I shall never forget, though it
seemed to occupy less than a quarter of the time consumed by one tick
of the watch. It was the death-cry wrung from our captain, killed
as he stood at the wheel. For his heedlessness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
in fitting out the
expedition, his life was the penalty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disabled and Drifting Helplessly.</div>

<p>We listened, but the friendly voice from the tug was hushed. We were
disabled, and drifting helplessly in front of the enemy's guns!</p>

<p>For a moment all was silent. Then there rose from the shore the
shrill, sharp, ragged yell so familiar to the ears of every man who
has been in the front, and clearly distinguishable from the deep,
full, chest-tones in which our own men were wont to give their
cheers. Many times had I heard that Rebel yell, but never when it was
vociferous and exultant as now.</p>

<p>Seeing fire among the hay-bales about us, Colburn and myself
carefully extinguished it with our gloved hands, lest the barge
should be burnt. Then, creeping out of our refuge, we discovered the
uselessness of our care.</p>

<p>That shot had done wonderful execution. It had killed the
captain, exploded the boiler, then passed into the furnace, where
the shell itself exploded, throwing up great sheets of glowing
coals upon both barges. At some stage of its progress, it had
cut in twain the tug, which went down like a plummet. We looked
for it, but it had disappeared altogether. There was some <span
lang="fr">d&eacute;bris</span>&mdash;chairs, stools, and parts of
machinery, buoyed up by timbers, floating upon the surface; but there
was no tug.</p>

<p>The barges, covered with bales of dry hay, had caught like tinder,
and now, at the stern of each, a great sheet of flame rose far toward
the sky, filling the night with a more than noonday glare.</p>

<p>Upon the very highest bale, where the flames threw out his pale face
and dark clothing in very sharp relief, stood "Junius," in a careless
attitude, looking upon the situation with the utmost serenity. My
first thought was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
that the one thing he required to complete the
picture was an opera-glass. To my earnest injunction to leave that
exposed position, he replied that, so far as safety was concerned,
there now was little choice of places.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we were under hotter fire than at any previous moment. In
the confusion caused by our evolutions in the eddies, I had quite
lost the points the of compass, and asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In which direction is Vicksburg?"</p>

<p>"There," replied "Junius," pointing out into the lurid smoke.</p>

<p>"I think it must be on the other shore."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! wait here a moment, and you will see the flash of the guns."</p>

<p>Just then I did see the flash of more guns than I coveted, and four
or five shots came shrieking toward us.</p>

<p>Colburn and myself instinctively dropped behind the nearest
hay-bales. A moment after, we were amused to observe that we had
sought shelter on the wrong side of the bales&mdash;the side facing the
Rebel guns. Our barge was so constantly changing position that our
geographical ideas had become very confused.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bombarding, Scalding, Burning, Drowning.</div>

<p>It does not often happen to men, in one quarter of an hour, to see
death in as many forms as confronted us&mdash;by bombarding, scalding,
burning, and drowning. It was uncomfortable, but less exciting than
one might suppose. The memory impresses me far more deeply than did
the experience. I remember listening, during a little cessation of
the din, for the sound of my own voice, wondering whether its tones
were calm and equable. There was hurrying to and fro, and groans rent
the air.</p>

<p>"I suppose we can surrender," cried a poor, scalded fellow. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span></p>

<p>"Surrender&mdash;the devil!" replied Colburn. "I suppose we will fight
them!"</p>

<p>It was very creditable to the determination of our <span
lang="fr">confr&egrave;re</span>; but, to put it mildly, our fighting
facilities just then were somewhat limited.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Taking to a Hay-Bale.</div>

<p>My comrades assisted nearly all wounded and scalded men down the
sides of the barge to the water's edge, and placed them carefully
upon hay-bales. Remaining there, we had every thing to lose and
nothing to gain, and I urged&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let us take to the water."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," my friends replied, "we will after awhile."</p>

<p>Soon, I repeated the suggestion, and they repeated the answer. It
was no time to stand upon forms. I jumped into the river&mdash;twelve or
fifteen feet below the top of our barge. They rolled over a hay-bale
for me. I climbed upon it, and found it a surprisingly comfortable
means of navigation. At last, free from the instinctive dread of
mutilation by splinters, which had constantly haunted me, I now felt
that if wounded at all it must, at least, be by a clean shot. The
thought was a great relief.</p>

<p>With a dim suspicion&mdash;not the ripe and perfect knowledge afterward
obtained&mdash;that clothing was scarce in the Southern Confederacy,
I removed my boots, tied them together with my watch-guard, and
fastened them to one of the hoops of the bale. Taking off my coat, I
secured it in the same manner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Overturned by a Shot.</div>

<p>I was about swimming away in a vague, blundering determination not
to be captured, when, for the first time in my life, I saw a shot
coming toward me. I had always been sceptical on this point. Many
persons had averred to me that they could see shots approaching; but
remembering that such a missile flying toward a man with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
scream and a rush would not quicken his vision, and judging from my
own experience, I supposed they must be deceived.</p>

<p>Now, far up the river I saw a shot coming with vivid distinctness.
How round, smooth, shining, and black it looked, ricochetting along,
plunging into the water, throwing up great jets of spray, bounding
like a schoolboy's ball, and then skimming the river again! It struck
about four feet from my hay-bale, which was now a few yards from the
burning barge.</p>

<p>The great sheet of water which dashed up quite obscured me from
Colburn and "Junius," who, upon the bows of the barge, were just
bidding me adieu. At first they thought the shot an extinguisher. But
it did me no greater harm than partially to overturn my hay-bale and
dip me into the river. A little more or less dampness just then was
not of much consequence. It was the last shot which I saw or heard.
The Rebels now ceased firing, and shouted&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have you no boats?"</p>

<p>Learning that we had none, they sent out a yawl. I looked about for
a plank, but could find none adapted to a long voyage. Rebel pickets
were on both sides of the river, and Rebel batteries lined it ten or
twelve miles below, at a point which, by floating, one could reach at
daylight. Surrender seemed the only alternative.</p>

<p>At Memphis, two days before, I had received a package of letters,
including two or three from the <cite>Tribune</cite> office, and some which
treated of public men, and military strength, movements, and
prospects, with great freedom. One of them, from Admiral Foote,
containing some very kind words, I sorely regretted to lose; but the
package was quite too valuable to be submitted to the scrutiny of
the enemy. I kept it until the last moment, but when the Rebel yawl
approached within twenty feet, tore the letters in pieces and threw
them into the Mississippi. </p>

<div class="sidenote">Rescued from the River.</div>

<p>The boat was nearly full. After picking me up, it received on board
two scalded men who were floating near, and whose groans were
heart-rending.</p>

<p>We were deposited on the Mississippi shore, under guard of four
or five soldiers in gray, and the yawl went back to receive the
remainder. Among the saved I found Surgeon Davidson. He was unable
to swim, but some one had carefully placed him upon a hay-bale. On
reaching the shore, he sat down upon a stool, which he had rescued
from the river, spread his overcoat upon his knee, and deposited his
carpet-sack beside him. It was the first case I ever knew of a man so
hopelessly shipwrecked, who saved all his baggage, and did not even
wet his feet.</p>

<p>The boat soon returned. To my infinite relief, the first persons who
sprang to the shore were "Junius" and Colburn. Sartorially they had
been less fortunate than I. One had lost his coat, and the other was
without shoes, stockings, coat, vest, or hat.</p>

<p>There, in the moonlight, guarded by Rebel bayonets, we counted the
rescued, and found that just sixteen&mdash;less than half our number&mdash;were
alive and unharmed. All the rest were killed, scalded, or wounded.</p>

<p>Some of the scalded were piteous spectacles. The raw flesh seemed
almost ready to drop from their faces; and they ran hither and
thither, half wild from excruciating pain.</p>

<p>None of the wounded were unable to walk, though one or two had broken
arms. The most had received slight contusions, which a few days would
heal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Killed, Wounded, and Missing.</div>

<p>The missing numbered eight or ten, not one of whom was ever heard of
afterward. It was impossible to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
obtain any correct list of their names, as several of them were
strangers to us and to each other; and no record had been made of the
persons starting upon the expedition.</p>

<p>We were two miles below the city, whither the lieutenant of our guard
now marched us. </p>

<div class="sidenote">Standing by Our Colors.</div>

<p>On the way, one of our party enjoined my colleague and myself&mdash;</p>

<p>"You had better not say <cite>Tribune</cite> to the Rebels. Tell
them you are correspondents of some less obnoxious journal."</p>

<p>Months before, I had asked three Confederate officers&mdash;paroled
prisoners within our lines:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What would you do with a <cite>Tribune</cite> correspondent,
if you captured him?" With the usual recklessness, two had
answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We would hang him upon the nearest sapling."</p>

<p>This remembrance was not cheering; but as we were the first
correspondents of a radical Northern journal who had fallen into the
enemy's hands, after a moment's interchange of views, we decided to
stand by our colors, and tell the plain truth. It proved much the
wiser course.</p>

<p>One of the rescued men, coatless and hatless, with his face blackened
until he looked like a native of Timbuctoo, addressed me familiarly.
Unable to recognize him, I asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Why," he replied, "I am Captain Ward."<a name="FNanchor_15_15"

<div class="sidenote">Confinement in the Vicksburg Jail.</div>

<p>When the explosion occurred, he was sitting on the hurricane roof
of the tug. It was more exposed than any other position, but the
officers of the boat had shown symptoms of fear, and he determined
to be where his revolver would enable him to control them if they
attempted to desert us.</p>

<p>Some missile struck his head and stunned him. When he recovered
consciousness, the tug had gone to the bottom, and he was struggling
in the river. He had strength enough to clutch a rope hanging over
the side of a barge, and keep his head above water. Permitting his
sword and revolver, which greatly weighed him down, to sink, he
called to his men on the blazing wreck. Under the hot fire of cannon
and musketry, they formed a rope of their belts, and let it down to
him. He fastened it under his arms; they lifted him up to the barge,
whence he escaped by the hay-bale line.</p>

<p>At Vicksburg, the commander of the City Guards registered our names.</p>

<p>"I hope, sir," said Colburn, "that you will give us comfortable
quarters."</p>

<p>With a half-surprised expression, the major replied, dryly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, sir; we will do the best we can for you."</p>

<p>"The best" proved ludicrously bad. Just before daylight we were taken
into the city jail. Its foul yard was half filled with criminals
and convicts, black and white, all dirty and covered with vermin.
In its midst was an open sewer, twelve or fifteen feet in diameter,
the grand receptacle of all the prison filth. The rising sun of
that sultry morning penetrated its reeking depths, and produced the
atmosphere of a pest-house.</p>

<p>We dried our clothing before a fire in the yard, conversed with the
villainous-looking jail-birds, and laughed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
about this unexpected result of our adventure. We had felt the danger
of wounds or death; but it had not occurred to either of us that we
might be captured. One of the private soldiers had paid a dollar for
the privilege of coming on the expedition. To our query whether he
deemed the money well invested, he replied that he would not have
missed the experience for ten times the amount. One youth, confined
in the jail for thieving, asked us the question, with which we were
soon to grow familiar:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What did you all come down here for, to steal our niggers?"</p>

<p>At noon we were taken out and marched through the streets.
"Junius's" bare and bleeding feet excited the sympathy of a lady, who
immediately sent him a pair of stockings, requesting if ever he met
any of "our soldiers" suffering in the North, that he would do as
much for them. The donor&mdash;Mrs. Arthur&mdash;was a very earnest
Unionist, with little sympathy for "our soldiers," but used the
phrase as one of the habitual subterfuges of the Loyalists.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The First Glimpse of Sambo.</div>

<p>While we waited in the office of the Provost-Marshal, I obtained a
first brief glimpse of the inevitable negro. Just outside the open
window, which extended to the floor, stood an African, with great
shining eyes, expressing his sympathy through remarkable grimaces and
contortions, bowing, scraping, and</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"Husking his white ivories like an ear of corn."</p>
</div>

<p>Rebel citizens and soldiers were all about him; and, somewhat
alarmed, I indicated by a look that he should be a little less
demonstrative. But Sambo, as usual, knew what he was doing, and was
not detected.</p>

<p>The Provost-Marshal, Captain Wells, of the Twenty-eighth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
Louisiana Infantry, courteously assigned to us the upper story of the
court-house, posting a sentinel at the door.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Paroled to Return Home.</div>

<p>Major Watts, the Rebel Agent of Exchange, called upon us and
administered the following parole:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p class="center">CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA.</p>
   <p class="quotdate"><span class="smcap">Vicksburg,
   Mississippi</span>, <i>May 4, 1863</i>.</p>

   <p>This is to certify, that in accordance with a Cartel in regard
   to an exchange of prisoners entered into between the Governments of
   the United States of America and the Confederate States of America,
   on the 22d day of July, 1862, Albert D. Richardson, citizen of New
   York, who was captured on the 4th day of May, at Vicksburg, and has
   since been held as a prisoner of war by the military authorities
   of the said Confederate States, is hereby paroled, <em>with full
   leave to return to his country</em> on the following conditions,
   namely: that he will not take up arms again, nor serve as military
   police or constabulary force in any fort, garrison, or field-work,
   held by either of said parties, nor as a guard of prisoners,
   d&eacute;p&ocirc;ts, or stores, nor discharge any duty usually
   performed by soldiers, until exchanged under the Cartel referred
   to. The aforesaid Albert D. Richardson signifying his full and free
   consent to said conditions by his signature hereto, thereby solemnly
   pledges his word and honor to a due observance of the same.</p>

   <p class="quotsig">Albert D. Richardson.</p>
   <p style="text-indent: 2em;"><span class="smcap">N. G. Watts</span>,<br />
   <em>Major Confederate States Army, and Agent for Exchange of Prisoners</em>.
   </p>
</div>

<p>This parole was regular, formal, and final, taken at a regular
point of exchange, by an officer duly appointed under the express
provisions of the cartel. Major Watts informed us that he was
prevented from sending us across the lines at Vicksburg, only because
Grant's operations had suspended flag-of-truce communication. He
assured us, that while he was thus compelled to forward us to
Richmond, the only other point of exchange, we should not be detained
there beyond the arrival of the first truce-boat. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Turning the Tables Handsomely.</div>

<p>These formalities ended, the major, who was a polite, kind-hearted,
rather pompous little officer, made an attempt at condolence and
consolation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"Gentlemen," said he, with a good deal of self-complacency, "you
   are a long way from home. However, do not despond; I have met a great
   many of your people in this condition; I have paroled some thousands
   of them, first and last. In fact, I confidently expect, within the
   next ten days, to see Major-General Grant, who commands your army, a
   prisoner in this room."</p>
</div>

<p>We knew something about that! Of course, we were familiar with the
size of Grant's army; and, before we had been many hours in the Rebel
lines, we found Union people who told us minutely the strength of
Pemberton. So we replied to the prophet, that, while we had no sort
of doubt of his seeing General Grant there, it would not be exactly
in the capacity of a prisoner!</p>

<p>Colburn&mdash;who had the good fortune, for that occasion, to be attached
to <cite>The World</cite>, and who, on reaching Richmond, was sent home by
the first truce-boat&mdash;came back to Vicksburg in season to be in at
the death. One of the first men he met, after the capture of the
city, was Watts, to whom he rehearsed this little scene, with the
characters reversed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"Major," said he, with dry humor, "you are a long distance from
   home! But do not despond; I have seen a good many of your people in
   this condition. In fact, I believe there are about thirty thousand
   of them here to-day, including Lieutenant-General Pemberton, who
   commands <em>your</em> army."</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Visits from Many Rebels.</div>

<p>We stayed in Vicksburg two days. Our noisy advent made us objects
of attention. Several Rebel journalists visited us, with tenders of
clothing, money, and any assistance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
they could render. Confederate officers and citizens called in large
numbers, inquiring eagerly about the condition of the North, and the
public feeling touching the war.</p>

<p>Some complained that Northern officers, while in confinement, had
said to them: "While we are in favor of the Union, we disapprove
altogether the war as conducted by this Abolition Administration,
with its tendencies to negro equality;" but that, after reaching
home, the same persons were peculiarly radical and bloodthirsty.</p>

<p>As political affairs were the only topic of conversation, we had
excellent opportunity for preventing any similar misunderstanding
touching ourselves. Courteously, but frankly, we told them that we
were in favor of the war, of emancipation, and of arming the negroes.
They manifested considerable feeling, but used no harsh expressions.
Two questions they invariably asked:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"What are you going to do with us, after you have subjugated
   us?" and, "What will you do with the negroes, after you have freed
   them?"</p>
</div>

<p>They talked much of our leading officers, all seeming to consider
Rosecrans the best general in the Union service. Nearly all used the
stereotyped Rebel expression:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"You can never conquer seven millions of people on their own
   soil. We will fight to the last man! We will die in the last
   ditch!"</p>
</div>

<p>We reminded them that the determination they expressed was by no
means peculiar to them, referring to Bancroft, in proof that even the
Indian tribes, at war with the early settlers of New England, used
exactly the same language. We asked one Texan colonel, noticeably
voluble concerning the "last ditch," what he meant by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
it&mdash;if he really intended to fight after their armies should be
dispersed and their cities taken.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" he replied, "you don't suppose I'm a fool, do you? As long
as there is any show for us, we shall fight you. If you win, most of
us will go to South America, Mexico, or Europe."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Interview with Jacob Thompson.</div>

<p>On Monday evening, Major-General Forney, of Alabama, sent an officer
to escort us to his head-quarters. He received us with great
frigidity, and we endeavored to be quite as icy as he. With some of
his staff officers, genial young fellows educated in the North, we
had a pleasant chat.</p>

<p>Jacob Thompson, of Mississippi, Buchanan's Secretary of the Interior,
and now a colonel on the staff of Lieutenant-General Pemberton, was
at the same head-quarters. With the suavity of an old politician,
he conversed with us for two or three hours. He asserted that some
of our soldiers had treated his aged mother with great cruelty. He
declared that Northern dungeons now contained at least three thousand
inoffensive Southern citizens, who had never taken up arms, and were
held only for alleged disloyalty.</p>

<p>Many other Rebel officers talked a great deal about arbitrary arrests
in the North. Several gravely assured us that, in the South, from the
beginning of the war, no citizen had ever been arrested, except by
due process of law, under charges well defined, and publicly made. We
were a little astounded, afterward, to learn how utterly bare-faced
was this falsehood.</p>

<p>On Tuesday evening we started for Jackson, Mississippi, in
company with forty other Union prisoners. They were mainly from Ohio
regiments, young in years, but veteran soldiers&mdash;farmers' sons,
with intelligent, earnest faces. Pemberton's army was in motion. Our
train
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
passed slowly through his camps, and halted half an hour at
several points, among crowds of Rebel privates.</p>

<p>The Ohio boys and their guards were on the best possible terms,
drinking whisky and playing euchre together. The former indulged in a
good deal of verbal skirmishing with the soldiers outside, thrusting
their heads from the car windows and shouting:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look out, Rebs! The Yankees are coming! Keep on marching, if you
don't want old Grant to catch you!"</p>

<p>"How are times in the North?" the Confederates replied. "Cotton a
dollar and twenty-five cents a pound in New York!"</p>

<p>"How are times in the South? Flour one hundred and seventy-five
dollars a barrel in Vicksburg, and none to be had at that!"</p>

<p>After waiting vainly for an answer to this quenching retort, the
Buckeyes sang "Yankee Doodle," the "Star-Spangled Banner," and "John
Brown's Body lies a-moldering in the Ground," for the edification of
their bewildered foes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrival in Jackson, Mississippi.</div>

<p>Before dark, we reached Jackson. Though a prisoner, I entered it
with far more pleasurable feelings than at my last visit; for my
tongue was now free, and I was not sailing under false colors. The
dreary little city was in a great panic. Before we had been five
minutes in the street, a precocious young newsboy came running among
us, and, while shouting&mdash;"Here's <cite>The Mississippian</cite> extra!"
talked to us incessantly in a low tone:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"How are you, Yanks? You have come in a capital time. Greatest
   panic you ever saw. Everybody flying out of town. Governor Pettus
   issued a proclamation, telling the people to stand firm, and then ran
   away himself before the ink was dry."</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Kindness from Southern Editors.</div>

<p>We remained in Jackson three days. Upon parole,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
we were allowed to take our meals at a boarding-house several squares
from the prison, and to visit the office of <cite>The Appeal</cite>. This
journal, originally published at Memphis, was removed to Grenada
upon the approach of our forces; Grenada being threatened, it was
transferred to Jackson; thence to Atlanta, and finally to Montgomery,
Alabama. It was emphatically a moving <cite>Appeal</cite>.</p>

<p>Its editors very kindly supplied us with clothing and money. They
seemed to be sick of the war, and to retain little faith in the Rebel
cause, for which they had sacrificed so much, abandoning property in
Memphis to the amount of thirty thousand dollars. They now published
the most enterprising and readable newspaper in the South. It was
noticeably free from vituperation, calling the President "Mr.
Lincoln," instead of the "Illinois Baboon," and characterizing us not
as Yankee scoundrels, but as "unwilling guests"&mdash;</p>

   <p>"Gentlemen who attempted to run the batteries on Sunday night,
   and after escaping death from shot and shell, from being scalded by

<p>Grant's army was moving toward Jackson. We longed for his approach,
straining our ears for the booming of his guns. The Rebels, in their
usual strain, declared that the city could not be captured, and would
be defended to the last drop of blood. But on the night before our
departure, we were confidentially told that the Federal advance was
already within twenty-five miles, and certain to take the town.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Project for Escape.</div>

<p>With forty-five unarmed prisoners, we were placed on an ammunition
train, which had not more than a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
dozen guards. The privates begged Captain Ward to lead them, and
permit them to capture the train. We all deemed the project feasible.
Ten minutes would suffice to blow up the cars. With twelve guns, we
could easily march twenty miles through those sparse settlements to
Grant's forces.</p>

<p>But there were our paroles! A careful reading convinced us that if
we failed in the attempt, the enemy would be justified, under the
laws of war, in punishing us with death; and, after much debate, we
abandoned the project.</p>

<p>Rebel officers in Vicksburg had assured us that crossing the
Confederacy from the Mississippi to the Atlantic, upon the Southern
railroads, was a more hazardous undertaking than running the river
batteries. The rolling stock was in wretched condition, and fatal
accidents frequently occurred; but we traveled at a leisurely,
old-fashioned rate, averaging eight miles per hour, making long
stops, and seldom running by night. </p>

<p>It did not require many days of captivity to teach us the infinite
expressiveness and trustworthiness of the human eye. We began to
recognize Union people by their friendly look before they spoke a
word.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Word with a Union Woman.</div>

<p>Our train stopped for dinner at a secluded Mississippi tavern. At the
door of the long dining-room stood the landlady, an intelligent woman
of about thirty-five. When I handed her a twenty-dollar Rebel note,
she inquired&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have you nothing smaller than this?"</p>

<p>"No Confederate money," I answered.</p>

<p>"State currency will answer just as well."</p>

<p>"I have none of that&mdash;nothing but this bill and United States
Treasury Notes."</p>

<p>The indifferent face instantly kindled into friendliness and sympathy.</p>

<p>"Are you one of the prisoners?"</p>

<p>"Yes, madam."</p>

<p>"Just from Vicksburg?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What do you think of the prospect?"</p>

<p>"Grant is certain to capture the city."</p>

<p>"Of course he will" (with great earnestness), "if he only tries! The
force there is incapable of resisting him."</p>

<p>Other passengers coming within hearing, I moved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
away, but I would unhesitatingly have trusted that woman with my
liberty or my life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grierson's Great Mississippi Raid.</div>

<p>Grierson's raid, then in progress, was the universal theme of
conversation and wonder. That dashing cavalier, selecting his route
with excellent judgment, evaded all the large forces which opposed
him, and defeated all the small ones, while he rode leisurely the
entire length of Mississippi, tearing up railroads and burning
bridges. Occasionally he addressed the people in humorous harangues.
To one old lady, who tremblingly begged that her property might not
be destroyed, he replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You shall certainly be protected, madam. It is not my object to
hurt any body. It is not generally known, but the truth is, I am a
candidate for Governor, and am stumping the State."</p>

<p>Our slow progress enabled us to converse much with the people,
constantly preaching to them the gospel of the Union. But they had
so long heard only the gospel according to Jefferson Davis, that
they paid little heed to our threatenings of the judgment which was
certain to come.</p>

<p>In the dense woods which the railways traversed, the pine, the palm
and the magnolia, grew side by side, festooned with long, hairy tufts
of Spanish moss. On the plantations, the young cotton, three inches
high, looked like sprouting beans.</p>

<p>Colburn's solemn waggery was constantly cropping out. In our
car one day he had a long discussion with a brawny Texan officer,
who declared with great bitterness that he had assisted in hanging
three Abolitionists upon a single blackjack,<a name="FNanchor_16_16"
id="FNanchor_16_16" href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>
in sight of his own door. He concluded with the usual
assertion:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">An Enraged Texan Officer.</div>

<p>"We will fight to the last man! We will die in the last ditch!"</p>

<p>"Well, sir," replied Colburn, with the utmost gravity, "if you should
do that and all be killed, we should regret it extremely!"</p>

<p>Like most Southerners, the Texan was insensible to satire.
Understanding this to be perfectly sincere, he reiterated:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We shall do it, sir! We shall do it!"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, as I said before, if you do, and all happen to <em>get</em>
killed, including the very last man himself, of course we of the
North shall be quite heart-broken!"</p>

<p>Once comprehended, the mock condolence enraged the huge Texan
fearfully. For a few seconds his eyes were the most wicked I ever
saw. He looked ready to spring upon Colburn and tear him in pieces;
but it was the last we heard of his bravado.</p>

<p>One of our fellow-prisoners had manifested great trepidation while
we lay disabled in front of Vicksburg. He was probably no more
frightened than the rest of us, but had less self-control, running to
and fro on the burning barge, wringing his hands, and shrieking: "My
God! my God! We shall all be killed!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Waggery of a Captured Scribe.</div>

<p>Three or four days later, Colburn asked him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Were you ever under fire before Sunday night?"</p>

<p>"Never," he replied, with uneasy, questioning looks.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," solemnly continued the satirist, "I think, in view of
that fact, that you behaved with more coolness than any man I ever
saw!"</p>

<p>While we preserved our gravity with the utmost difficulty, the victim
scrutinized his tormentor very suspiciously. But that serious,
immovable face told no tales, and he finally received the compliment
as serious. From
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
that time, it was Colburn's daily delight, to remark, with
ever-increasing admiration:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. ----, I cannot help remembering how marvelously
self-possessed you were during those exciting minutes. I never saw
your coolness equaled by a man under fire for the first time."</p>

<p>Before we reached Richmond, the new-fledged hero received his praises
with complacent and serene condescension. He will, doubtless, tell
his children and grandchildren of the encomium his courage won from
companions, who, "born and nursed in Danger's path, had dared her
worst."</p>

<p>At Demopolis, Alabama, we encountered a planter removing from
Mississippi, where Grierson and Grant were rapidly depreciating
slave property. He had with him a long gang of negroes, some chained
together in pairs, with handcuffs riveted to their wrists.</p>

<p>While the train stopped, a young fellow from Kentucky, captain and
commissary in the Confederate army, took me up to his room, on
pretext of "a quiet drink."</p>

<p>"When I went into the war," said he, "I thought it would be a nice
little diversion of about two weeks, with a good deal of fun and no
fighting. Now, I would give my right arm to escape from it; but there
is no such good fortune for me. When you reach the North, write to my
friends at home, giving them my love, and saying that I wish I had
followed their advice."</p>

<p>A benevolent lady was at the station, with her carriage, distributing
cakes among the Rebel soldiers and the Union prisoners.</p>

<p>At Selma, a new officer took charge of our party. The post commandant
instructed him how to treat the privates, and, pointing to the two
officers and the three journalists, added:&mdash; </p>

<div class="sidenote">The Alabama River and Montgomery.</div>

<p>"You will consider these gentlemen not under your guard, but under
your escort."</p>

<p>We took a steamer up the Alabama River. As we sat looking out upon
the beautiful stream, it was amusing to hear the comments of the
negro chamber-maids:&mdash;</p>

<p>"How mean the Southern soldiers look! But just see those Yankees!
Anybody might know that they are God's own people!"</p>

<p>The pilot of the boat, a native Alabamian, took me aside, stating
that he was an unconditional Union man, and inquiring eagerly about
the North, which, he feared, might abandon the contest.</p>

<p>We spent Sunday, May 11th, in the pleasant city of Montgomery:
strolling at pleasure through the shaded streets, and at evening
taking a bath in the Alabama, swimming round a huge Rebel ram,
then nearly completed. We gained some knowledge of its character
and dimensions, which, after reaching Richmond, we succeeded in
transmitting to the Government.</p>

<p>The officer in charge of our party spent the night in camp with
his men, but we slept at the Exchange Hotel. When we registered our
names, the bystanders, with their broad-brimmed hats, long pipes, and
heavy Southern faces, manifested a good deal of curiosity to see what
they termed "two of old Greeley's correspondents." They asked us many
questions of the North, and of our army experiences. Several said
emphatically that, ere long, the people would "take this thing out of
the hands of politicians, and settle it themselves."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Atlanta Editors Advocate Hanging Us.</div>

<p>Reaching Atlanta, we were placed in the filthy, vermin-infested
military prison. Encouraged by the courtesies we had received from
Rebel journals, we sent, through the commandant, a card to one of the
newspaper offices, asking for a few exchanges. The blundering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
messenger took it to the wrong establishment, leaving it at the office
of an intensely bitter sheet called <cite>The Confederate</cite>. The
next morning we were not allowed to purchase newspapers. Learning that
<cite>The Confederate</cite> commented upon our request, we induced an
<span lang="fr">attach&eacute;</span> of the prison to smuggle a copy
to us, and found the following leader:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"Last evening some correspondents of <cite>The New York
   World</cite> and <cite>New York Tribune</cite> were brought here
   among a batch of prisoners captured at Vicksburg a few days ago. They
   had not been here a half hour before the impudent scamps got one of
   the sentinels guarding the barracks to go around to the newspaper
   offices in this city with their 'card,' requesting the favor of some
   exchange-papers to read. Their impudence is beyond comprehension,
   upon any other consideration than that they belong to the Yankee
   press-gang. Yankees are everywhere more impudent than any honest race
   of people can be, and a Yankee newspaper-man is the quintessence of
   all impudence. We thought we had seen and understood something of
   this Yankee accomplishment in times gone by (some specimens of it
   have been seen in the South); but the unheard-of effrontery that
   prompted these villains, who, caught in company with the thieving,
   murdering vandals who have invaded our country, despoiled our homes,
   murdered our citizens, destroyed our property, violated our wives,
   sisters, and daughters, to boldly claim of the press of the South
   the courtesies and civilities which gentlemen of the press usually
   extend to each other, is above and beyond all the unblushing audacity
   we ever imagined. They had come along with Northern vandals, to
   chronicle their rapes, arsons, plunders, and murders, and to herald
   them to the world as deeds of heroism, greatness, and glory. They
   are our vilest and most unprincipled enemies&mdash;far more deeply
   steeped in guilt, and far more richly deserving death, than the
   vilest vandal that ever invaded the sanctity of our soil and outraged
   our homes and our peace. We would greatly prefer to assist in
   hanging these enemies to humanity, than to show them any civilities
   or courtesies. The common robber, thief, and murderer, is more
   respectable, in our estimation, than these men; for he never tries
   to make his crimes respectable, but always to conceal them. These
   men, however, have come into our country with the open robbers and
   murderers of our people, for the express purpose of whitewashing
   their hellish deeds, and presenting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>

   them to the world as great deeds of virtuous heroism. They deserve a
   rope's end, and will not receive their just deserts till their crimes
   are punished with death."</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">A Pair of Renegade Vermonters.</div>

<p>The Rebel authorities were very sensitive to newspaper censure.
With unusual rigor, they now refused us permission to go outside
the prison for meals, though offering to have them sent in, at
our expense, from the leading hotel. They told us that <cite>The
Confederate</cite> was edited by two renegade Vermonters.</p>

<p>"I am not very fond of Yankees, myself," remarked Hunnicutt, the
heavy-jawed, broad-necked, coarse-featured lieutenant commanding
the prison. "I am as much in favor of hanging them as anybody; but
these Vermonters, who haven't been here six months, are a little
too violent. They don't own any niggers. 'Tisn't natural. There's
something wrong about them. If I were going to hang Yankees at a
venture, I think I would begin with them."</p>

<p>An Irish warden brought us, from a Jew outside, three hundred
Confederate dollars, in exchange for one hundred in United States
currency. For a fifty-dollar Rebel note he procured me a cap of
southern manufacture, to replace my hat, which had been snatched
from my head by a South Carolina officer, passing upon a railroad
train meeting our own. The new cap, of grayish cotton, a marvel
of roughness and ugliness, elicited roars of laughter from my
comrades.</p>

<p>On the journey thus far, we had gone almost wherever we pleased,
unguarded and unaccompanied. But from Atlanta to Richmond we were
treated with rigor and very closely watched. A Rebel officer begged
of "Junius" his fine pearl-handled pocket knife. Receiving it, he
at once conceived an affection for a gold ring upon the prisoner's
finger. Even the courtesy of my colleague was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
proof against this second impertinence, and he contemptuously
declined the request.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Treated with Unusual Rigor.</div>

<p>The captain in charge of us stated that his orders were imperative
to keep all newspapers from us; and on no account to permit us to
leave the railway carriage. But, finding that we still obtained the
daily journals from fellow-passengers, he made a virtue of necessity,
and gracefully acquiesced. At last, he even allowed us to take our
meals at the station, upon being invited to participate in them at
the expense of his prisoners. </p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrival in Richmond.</div>

<p>At 5 o'clock on the morning of Saturday, May 16th, we reached
Richmond. At that early hour, the clothing-d&eacute;p&ocirc;t of the
Confederate government was surrounded by a crowd of poor, ill-clad
women, seeking work.</p>

<p>We were marched to the Libby Prison. Up to this time we had
never been searched. I had even kept my revolver in my pocket until
reaching Jackson, Mississippi, where, knowing I could not much longer
conceal it, I gave it to a friend. Now a Rebel sergeant carefully
examined our clothing. All money, except a few dollars, was taken
from us, and the flippant little prison clerk, named Ross, with some
inquiries not altogether affectionate concerning the health of Mr.
Greeley, gave us receipts.</p>

<p>As we passed through the guarded iron gateway, I glanced
instinctively above the portal in search of its fitting
legend:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"Abandon all hope who enter here."</p>
</div>

<p>Up three flights of stairs, we were escorted into a room, fifty
feet by one hundred and twenty-five, filled with officers lying in
blankets upon the floor and upon rude bunks. Some shouted, "More
Yankees!&mdash;more Yankees!" while many crowded about us to hear our
story, and learn the news from the West. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Incarcerated in Libby Prison.</div>

<p>We soon found friends, and became domesticated in our novel
quarters. With the American tendency toward organization, the
prisoners divided into companies of four each. Our journalistic trio
and Captain Ward ceased to be individuals, becoming merely "Mess
Number Twenty-one."</p>

<p>The provisions, at this time consisting of good flour, bread, and
salt pork, were brought into the room in bulk. A commissary, elected
by the captives from their own number, divided them, delivering its
quota to each mess.</p>

<p>Picking up two or three rusty tin plates and rheumatic knives and
forks, we commenced housekeeping. The labor of preparation was not
arduous. It consisted in making little sacks of cotton cloth for
salt, sugar, pepper, and rice, fitting up a shelf for our dishes, and
spreading upon the floor blankets, obtained from our new comrades,
and originally sent to Richmond by the United States Government for
the benefit of prisoners.</p>

<p>The Libby authorities, and white and negro <span
lang="fr">attach&eacute;s</span>, were always hungry for
"greenbacks," and glad to give Confederate currency in exchange. The
rates varied greatly. The lowest was two dollars for one. During my
imprisonment, I bought fourteen for one, and, a few weeks after our
escape, thirty were given for one.</p>

<p>A prison sergeant went out every morning to purchase supplies.
He seemed honest, and through him we could obtain, at extravagant
prices, dried apples, sugar, eggs, molasses, meal, flour, and corn
burnt and ground as a substitute for coffee. Without these additions,
our rations would hardly have supported life.</p>

<p>In our mess, each man, in turn, did the cooking for an entire day.
In that hot, stifling room, frying pork, baking griddle-cakes, and
boiling coffee, over the crazy, smoking, broken stove, around which
there was a constant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
crowd, were disagreeable in the extreme. The prison hours were long,
but the cooking-days recurred with unpleasant frequency.</p>

<p>We scrubbed our room two or three times a week, and it was fumigated
every morning. At one end stood a huge wooden tank, with an abundant
supply of cold water, in which we could bathe at pleasure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sufferings from Vermin.</div>

<p>The vermin were the most revolting feature of the prison, and the
one to which it was the most difficult to become resigned. No amount
of personal cleanliness could guard our bodies against the insatiate
lice. Only by examining under-clothing and destroying them once or
twice a day, could they be kept from swarming upon us. For the first
week, I could not think of them without shuddering and faintness: but
in time I learned to make my daily entomological researches with calm
complacency.</p>

<p>In Nashville, two weeks before my capture, I met Colonel A.
D. Streight, of Indiana. At the head of a provisional brigade
from Rosecrans's army, he was about starting on a raid through
northern Alabama and Georgia. The expedition promising more romance
and novelty than ordinary army experiences, now grown a little
monotonous, I desired to accompany him; but other duties prevented. I
had been in Libby just four hours, when in walked Streight, followed
by the officers of his entire brigade. We had taken very different
routes, but they brought us to the same terminus.</p>

<p>Streight's command had been furnished with mules, averaging about
two years old, and quite unused to the saddle. Utterly worthless,
they soon broke down, and with much difficulty, he remounted his
men upon horses, pressed from the citizens; but the delay proved
fatal.</p>

<p>The Rebel General Forrest overtook him with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
largely superior force. Streight was an enterprising, brave officer,
and his exhausted men behaved admirably in four or five fights;
but at last, near Rome, Georgia, after losing one third of his
command, the colonel was compelled to surrender. The Rebels were very
exultant, and Forrest&mdash;originally a slave-dealer in Memphis, and
a greater falsifier than Beauregard himself&mdash;telegraphed that,
with four hundred men, he had captured twenty-eight hundred.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Charles Pavie, of the Eightieth Illinois, who commanded
Streight's artillery, came in with his coat torn to shreds; a piece
of shell had struck him in the back, inflicting only a flesh wound.
Upon feeling the shock, he instinctively clapped his hands to his
stomach, to ascertain if there was a hole there, under the impression
that the entire shell had passed through his body!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prisoners Denounced as Blasphemous.</div>

<p>The prisoners bore their confinement with good-humor and hilarity.
During the long evenings, they joined in the "Star-Spangled Banner,"
"Old Hundred," "Old John Brown," and other patriotic and religious
airs. <cite>The Richmond Whig</cite>, shocked that the profane and ungodly
Yankees should presume to sing "Old Hundred," denounced it as a piece
of blasphemy.</p>

<p>Captain Brown and his officers, of the United States gunboat
Indianola, were pointed out to me as men who had actually been in
prison for three months. I regarded them with pity and wonder. It
seemed utterly impossible that I could endure confinement for half
that time. After-experiences inclined me to patronize new-comers,
and regard with lofty condescension, men who had been prisoners only
twelve or fifteen months! "The Father of the Marshalsea" became an
intelligible and sympathetic personage, with whom we should have
hobnobbed delightfully. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Thievery of a "Virginia Gentleman."</div>

<p>Simultaneously with our arrival in Richmond, a Rebel officer
of the exchange bureau received a request from the editor of <cite>The
World</cite>, for the release of Mr. Colburn. It proved as efficient
as if it had been an order from Jefferson Davis. After ten days'
confinement in Libby, Colburn was sent home by the first truce-boat.
A thoroughly loyal gentleman, and an unselfish, devoted friend, he
was induced to go, only by the assurance that while he could do no
good by remaining, he might be of service to us in the North.</p>

<p>At his departure, he left for me, with Captain Thomas P. Turner,
commandant of the prison, fifty dollars in United States currency.
A day or two afterward, Turner handed the sum to me in Confederate
rags, dollar for dollar, asserting that this was the identical money
he had received. The perpetrator of this petty knavery was educated
at West Point, and claimed to be a Virginia gentleman.</p>

<p>"Junius" suffered greatly from intermittent fever. The weather was
torrid. In the roof was a little scuttle, to which we ascended by a
ladder. The column of air rushing up through that narrow aperture was
foul, suffocating, and hot as if coming from an oven. At night we
went out on the roof for two or three hours to breathe the out-door
atmosphere. When the authorities discovered it, they informed us,
through Richard Turner&mdash;an ex-Baltimorean, half black-leg
and half gambler, who was inspector of the prison&mdash;that if
we persisted, they would close the scuttle. It was a refined and
elaborate method of torture.</p>

<p>On one occasion, this same Turner struck a New York captain in the
face for courteously protesting against being deprived of a little
fragment of shell which he had brought from the field as a relic. A Rebel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
sergeant inflicted a blow upon another Union captain who chanced to
be jostled against him by the crowd.</p>

<p>For slight offenses, officers were placed in an underground cell
so dark and foul, that I saw a Pennsylvania lieutenant come out,
after five weeks' confinement there, his beard so covered with mold
that one could pluck a double handful from it!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prisoners Murdered by the
<del>Gaurds</del><ins>Guards</ins>.</div>

<p>Prisoners putting their heads for a moment between the bars of the
windows, and often for only approaching the apertures, were liable
to be shot. One officer, standing near a window, was ordered by
the sentinel to move back. The rattling carriages made the command
inaudible. The guard instantly shot him through the head, and he
never spoke again.</p>

<p>Colonel Streight was the most prominent prisoner. He talked to the
Rebel authorities with imprudent, but delightful frankness. More than
once I heard him say to them:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You dare not carry out that threat! You know our Government will
never permit it, but will promptly retaliate upon your own officers,
whom it holds."</p>

<p>When our rations of heavy corn-bread and tainted meat grew
very short, he addressed a letter to James A. Seddon, Confederate
Secretary of War, protesting in behalf of his brigade, and inquiring
whether he designed starving prisoners to death! The Rebels hated him
with peculiar bitterness.</p>

<p>The five Richmond dailies helped us greatly in filling up the long
hours. At daylight an old slave, named Ben, would arouse us from our
slumbers, shouting:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Great news in de papers! Great news from de Army of Virginny!
Great tallygraphic news from the Soufwest!" </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fourth-of-July Celebration Interrupted.</div>

<p>He disbursed his sheets at twenty-five cents per copy, but they
afterward went up to fifty.</p>

<p>A lieutenant in Grant's army, while charging one of the batteries
in the rear of Vicksburg, received a shot in the face which entered
one eye, destroying it altogether. Ten days after, he arrived in
Libby. He walked about our room with a handkerchief tied around his
head, smoking complacently, apparently considering a bullet in the
brain a very slight annoyance.</p>

<p>We attempted to celebrate the Fourth of July. Captain Driscoll,
of Cincinnati, with other ingenious officers, had manufactured from
shirts a National flag, which was hung above the head of Colonel
Streight, who occupied the chair, or rather the bed, which necessity
substituted. Two or three speeches had been made, and several hours
of oratory were expected, when a sergeant came up and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Captain Turner orders that you stop this furse!"</p>

<p>Observing the flag, he called upon several officers to assist
him in taking it down. Of course, none did so. He finally reached
it himself, tore it down, and bore it to the prison office. A long
discussion ensued about obeying Turner's order. After nearly as
much time had been consumed in debate as it would have required
to carry out the programme, and speak to all the toasts&mdash;dry
toasts&mdash;it was voted to comply. So the meeting, first adopting
a number of intensely patriotic resolutions, incontinently
adjourned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Horrors of Belle Isle.</div>

<p>The Rebel authorities confiscated large sums of money sent
from home to the prisoners, and sometimes stopped the purchase of
supplies, asserting that it was done in retaliation for similar
treatment of their own soldiers confined in the North. Still our
officers fared incomparably better than the Union privates who were
half

starved upon Belle Isle, in sight of our prison. We did not fully
accredit the reports which reached us touching the sufferings of
these prisoners, though the engravings of their emaciation and
tortures in the New York illustrated papers, which sometimes drifted
to us, so enraged the Rebels, that we often called their attention to
them. But our own paroled officers, who were permitted to distribute
among the privates clothing sent by our Government, assured us that
they were substantially true. </p>

<div class="sidenote">The Captains Ordered Below.</div>

<p>On the 6th of July, an order came to our apartments for all the
captains to go down into a lower room. At this time, as usual, there
was constant talk about resuming the exchange. They went below with
light hearts, supposing they were about to be paroled and sent North.
Half an hour after, when the first one returned, his white, haggard
face showed that he had been through a trying scene.</p>

<p>After being drawn up in line, they were required to draw lots,
to select two of their number for execution, in retaliation for
two Rebel officers, tried and shot in Kentucky by Burnside, for
recruiting within our lines.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two Selected for Execution.</div>

<p>The unhappy designation fell upon Captain Sawyer, of the First
New Jersey Cavalry, and Captain Flynn, of the Fifty-first Indiana
Infantry. They were taken to the office of General Winder, who
assured them that the sentence would be carried out; and without
pity or decency, selected that hour to revile them as Yankee
scoundrels who had "come down here to kill our sons, burn our houses,
and devastate our country." In reply to these taunts, they bore
themselves with dignity and calmness.</p>

<p>"When I went into the war," responded Flynn, "I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
knew I might be killed. I don't know but I would just as soon die in
this way as any other."</p>

<p>"I have a wife and child," said Sawyer, "who are very dear to me, but
if I had a hundred lives I would gladly give them all for my country."</p>

<p>In two hours they came back to their quarters. Sawyer was externally
nervous; Flynn calm. Both expected that the order would be carried
out. We were confident that it would not. I predicted to Sawyer&mdash;</p>

<p>"They will never dare to shoot you!"</p>

<p>"I will bet you a hundred dollars they do!" was his impulsive reply.
I said to Flynn&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is not one chance in ten of their executing you."</p>

<p>"I know it," he answered. "But, when we drew lots, I took one
chance in thirty-five, and then lost!"<a name="FNanchor_17_17"
id="FNanchor_17_17" href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>On the same evening came intelligence that, at an obscure town in
Pennsylvania called Gettysburg, Meade had received a Waterloo defeat,
was flying in confusion to the mountains of Pennsylvania after losing
forty thousand prisoners, who were actually on their way to Richmond.
It was entertaining to read the speculations of the Rebel papers as
to what they could do with these forty thousand Yankees&mdash;where
they could find men to guard them, and room for them&mdash;how in the
world they could feed them without starving the people of Richmond.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Gloomiest Night in Prison.</div>

<p>We did not fully believe the report, but it touched us very
nearly. Those reverses to our army came home drearily to the hearts
of men who were waiting hopelessly in Rebel prisons, and weighed them
down like millstones.</p>

<p>Success kindled a corresponding joy. I have seen sick and dying
prisoners on cold and filthy floors of the wretched hospitals filled
with a new vitality&mdash;their sad, pleading eyes lighted with a new
hope, their wan faces flushed, and their speech jubilant, when they
learned that all was going well with the Cause. It made life more
endurable and death less bitter.</p>

<p>Already suffering from anxiety for Flynn and Sawyer, and
disheartened by the reports from Pennsylvania, we received
intelligence that Grant had been utterly repulsed before the works
of Vicksburg, the siege raised, and the campaign closed in defeat
and disaster. It was a very black night when this grief was added to
the first. The prison was gloomy and silent many hours earlier than
usual. Our hearts were too heavy for speech.</p>

<p>But suddenly there came a great revulsion. Among the negro
prisoners was an old man of seventy, who had particularly
attra<ins>c</ins>ted my attention from the fact that when I happened
to speak to him about the National conflict, he replied, after the
manner of Copperheads, that it was a speculators' war on both sides,
in which he felt no sort of interest; that it would do nobody any
good; that he cared not when or how it ended. I wondered whether the
old African was shamming, lest his conversation should be reported,
to the curtailing of his privileges, or whether he was really that
anomaly, a black man who felt no interest in the war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Glorious Revulsion of Feeling.</div>

<p>But about five o'clock, one afternoon, he came up into our room, and,
when the door was closed behind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
him, so that he could not be seen by the officers or guards, he made
a rush for an open space upon the floor, and immediately began to
dance in a manner very remarkable for a man of seventy, and rheumatic
at that. We all gathered around him and asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"General" (that was his <span lang="fr">soubriquet</span> in the
prison), "what does this mean?"</p>

<p>"De Yankees has taken Vicksburg! De Yankees has taken Vicksburg!"
and then he began to dance again.</p>

<p>As soon as we could calm him into a little coherence, he drew from
his pocket a newspaper extra&mdash;the ink not yet dry&mdash;which he
had stolen from one of the Rebel officers. There it was! The Yankees
<em>had</em> taken Vicksburg, with more than thirty thousand prisoners.</p>

<p>Good tidings, like bad, seldom come alone. Shortly after,
we learned that there was also a slight mistake about
Gettysburg&mdash;that Lee, instead of Meade, was flying in confusion;
and that, while our people had captured fifteen or twenty thousand
Rebels, those forty thousand Yankee prisoners were "conspicuous for
their absence."</p>

<p>How our hearts leaped up at this cheering news! How suddenly that
foul prison air grew sweet and pure as the fragrant breath of the
mountains! There was laughing, there was singing, there was dancing,
which the old negro did not altogether monopolize. Some one shouted,
"Glory, hallelujah!" Mr. McCabe, an Ohio chaplain, whose clear,
ringing tones, as he led the singing, cheered many of our heaviest
hours, instantly took the hint, and started that beautiful hymn, by
Mrs. Howe, of which "Glory, hallelujah" is the chorus:&mdash;</p>

   <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i0">"For mine eyes have seen the glory of the
      coming of the Lord."</span>
   </div>
</div>

<p>Every voice in the room joined in it. I never saw men more stirred
and thrilled than were those three or four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>

they heard the impressive closing stanza:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exciting Discussion in Prison.</div>

<p>Despite reading, conversing, and cutting out finger-rings,
napkin-rings, breast-pins, and crosses, from the beef-bones extracted
from our rations, in which some prisoners were exceedingly skillful,
the hours were very heavy. A debating-club was formed, and much
time was spent in discussing animal magnetism and other topics.
Occasionally we had mock courts, which developed a good deal of
originality and wit.</p>

<p>Late in July, a mania for study began to prevail. Classes were
formed in Greek, Latin, German, French, Spanish, Algebra, Geometry,
and Rhetoric. We sent out to the Richmond stores for text-books, and
all found instructors, as the motley company of officers embraced
natives of every civilized country.</p>

<p>July 30th was a memorable day. The prisoners had become
greatly excited on the momentous question of small messes <span
lang="la">versus</span> large messes. There were only three
cooking-stoves for the accommodation of three hundred and
seventy-five officers. A majority thought it more convenient to
divide into messes of twenty, while others, favoring small messes of
from four to eight each, determined to retain those organizations.
The prisoners now occupied five rooms, communicating with each
other.</p>

<p>A public meeting was called in our apartment, with Colonel
Streight in the chair. A fiery discussion ensued. The large-mess
party insisted that the majority must rule, and the minority
submit to be formed into messes of twenty. The small-mess party
replied:&mdash; </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span></p>

<p>"We will not be coerced. We are one-third of all the prisoners. We
insist upon our right to one-third of the kitchen, one-third of the
fuel, and one of the three cooking-stoves. It is nobody's business
but our own whether we have messes of two or one hundred."</p>

<p>I was never present at any debate, parliamentary, political,
or religious, which developed more earnestness and bitterness.
The meeting passed a resolution, insisting upon large messes; the
small-mess party refused to vote upon it, and declared that they
would never, never submit! The question was finally decided by
permitting all to do exactly as they pleased.</p>

<p>Prisoners kept in the underground cells heard revolting stories.
They were informed by the guards that the bodies of the dead, usually
left in an adjoining room for a day or two before burial, were
frequently eaten by rats.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stealing Money from the Captives.</div>

<p>From want of vegetables and variety of diet, scurvy became common.
With many others, I suffered somewhat from it. On the 13th of August,
Major Morris, of the Sixth Pennsylvania Cavalry, died suddenly from
a malignant form of this disease. His fellow-prisoners desired to
have his body embalmed. The Rebel authorities had one hundred dollars
in United States curren<ins>c</ins>y, belonging to the major, but
they refused to apply it to this purpose. Four hundred dollars in
Confederate currency was therefore subscribed by the prisoners.
Several brother-officers of the deceased were permitted to follow the
remains to the cemetery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Horrible Treatment of Northern Citizens.</div>

<p>Thirty or forty Northern citizens were confined in a room under
us. They were thrust in with Yankee deserters of the worst character,
and treated with the greatest barbarity. Their rations were very
short; they were allowed to purchase nothing. We cut a hole through
the floor, and every evening dropped down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
crackers and bread, contributed from the various messes. When they
saw the food coming, they would crowd beneath the aperture, with
upturned faces and eager eyes, springing to clutch every crumb,
sometimes ready to fight over the smallest morsels, and looking more
like ravenous animals than human beings. Some of them, accustomed
to luxury at home, ate water-melon rinds and devoured morsels which
they extracted from the spittoons and from other places still more
revolting.</p>

<p>Several schemes of escape were ingenious and original. Impudence
was the trump card. Four or five officers took French leave, by
procuring Confederate uniforms, which enabled them to pass the
guards. Captain John F. Porter, of New York, obtaining a citizen's
suit, walked out of the prison in broad daylight, passing all the
sentinels, who supposed him to be a clergyman or some other pacific
resident of Richmond. A lady in the city secreted him. By the
negroes, he sent a message to his late comrades, asking for money,
which they immediately transmitted. Obtaining a pilot, he made his
way through the swamps to the Union lines, in season to claim, on the
appointed day, the hand of a young lady who awaited him at home. He
was an enterprising bridegroom.</p>

<p>During the long evenings, when we were faint, bilious, and
weak from our thin diet, some of my comrades, with morbid
eloquence, would dwell upon all luxuries that tempt the epicurean
palate,&mdash;debating, in detail, what dishes they would order,
were they at the best hotels of New York or Philadelphia. These
tantalizing discussions were so annoying that they invariably drove
me from the group, sometimes exciting a desire to strike those who
<em>would</em> drag forward the unpleasant subject, and keep me reminded of
the hunger which I was striving to forget. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Extravagant Rumors among the Prisoners.</div>

<p>The exchange was altogether suspended, and new prisoners
were constantly arriving, until Libby contained several hundred
officers.</p>

<p>Extravagant rumors of all sorts were constantly afloat among the
captives; hardly a day passing without some sensation story. They
were not usually pure invention; but in prison, as elsewhere during
exciting periods, the air seemed to generate wild reports, which, in
passing from mouth to mouth, grew to wonderful proportions. </p>

<div class="sidenote">Transferred to Castle Thunder.</div>

<p>On the evening of September 2d, all the northern citizens were
transferred from Libby to Castle Thunder. The open air caused a
strange sensation of faintness. We grew weak and dizzy in walking the
three hundred yards between the prisons.</p>

<p>That night we were thrust into an unventilated, filthy, subterranean
room, nearly as loathsome as the Vicksburg jail. But we smoked our
pipes serenely, remembering that "Fortune is turning, and inconstant,
and variations, and mutabilities," and wondering what that capricious
lady would next decree. At intervals, our sleep upon the dirty floor
was disturbed by the playful gambols of the rats over our hands and
faces.</p>

<p>The next morning we were drawn up in line, and our names registered
by an old warden named Cooper, who, in spectacles and faded silk hat,
looked like one of Dickens's beadles. His query whether we possessed
moneys, was uniformly answered in the negative. When he asked if we
had knives or concealed weapons, all gave the same response, except
one waggish prisoner, who averred that he had a ten-inch columbiad in
his vest pocket.</p>

<p>The Commandant of Castle Thunder was Captain George W. Alexander,
an ex-Marylander, who had participated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
with "the French Lady"<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"
href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> in the capture of
the steamer St. Nicholas, near Point Lookout, and was afterward
confined for some months at Fort McHenry. He formerly belonged to
the United States Navy, in the capacity of assistant engineer. He
made literary pretensions, writing thin plays for the Richmond
theaters, and sorry Rebel war-ballads. Pompous and excessively vain,
delighting in gauntlets, top-boots, huge revolvers, and a red sash,
he was sometimes furiously angry, but, in the main, kind to captives.
He caused us to be placed in the "Citizens' Room," which he called
the prison parlor. Its walls were whitewashed, its four windows
were iron-barred, its air tainted by exhalations from the adjoining
"Condemned Cell," which was fearfully foul. It was lighted with
gas, and had a single stove for cooking, a few bunks, and a clean
floor.</p>

<p>Castle Thunder contained about fifteen hundred
inmates&mdash;northern citizens, southern Unionists, Yankee
deserters, Confederate convicts, and eighty-two free negroes,
captured with Federal officers, who employed them as servants in the
field.</p>

<div class="sidenote">More Endurable than Libby.</div>

<p>The prison's reputation was worse than that of Libby; but, as
usual, we found the devil not quite so black as he was painted. We
missed sadly the society of the Union officers, but the Commandant
and <span lang="fr">attach&eacute;s</span>, unlike the Turners,
treated us courteously, never indulging in epithets and insults.</p>

<p>In the Citizens' Room were two northerners, named
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
Lewis and Scully, sent to Richmond in the secret service of our
Government, by General Scott, before the battle of Bull Run, and
confined ever since. One of them was a Catholic, through the
influence of whose priest both had thus far been preserved. But they
held existence by a frail tenure, and I could not wonder that long
anxiety had turned Lewis's hair gray, and given to both nervous,
haggard faces.</p>

<p>In all southern prisons I was forced to admire the fidelity with
which the Roman Church looks after its members. Priests frequently
visited all places of confinement to inquire for Catholics, and
minister both to their spiritual and bodily needs. The chaplain
at Castle Thunder was a Presbyterian. He scattered documents, and
preached every Sunday in the yard or one of the large rooms. He would
have given tracts on the sin of dancing to men without any legs.</p>

<p>The Rev. William G. Scandlin and Dr. McDonald, of
Boston&mdash;agents of the United States Sanitary
Commission&mdash;were held with us. The doctor was dangerously ill
from dysentery. The Commission had never discriminated between
suffering Unionists and Confederates, extending to both the same
bounty and tenderness; yet the Rebels kept these gentlemen, whom they
had captured on the way to Harper's Ferry with sanitary supplies, for
more than three months.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Determined not to Die.</div>

<p>"Junius" was very feeble; but during the weary months which
followed, he manifested wonderful vitality. His indignation toward
the enemy, and his earnest determination not to die in a Rebel
prison, greatly helped his endurance. Like the Duchess of Marlboro',
he refused either to be bled or to give up the ghost.</p>

<p>A Virginia citizen was brought in on the charge of attempting to
trade in "greenbacks,"&mdash;a penitentiary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
offense under Confederate law. Before he had been in our room five
minutes one of the sub-wardens entered, asking:</p>

<p>"Is there anybody here who has 'greenbacks?' I am paying four
dollars for one to-day."</p>

<p>The negroes were used for scrubbing and carrying messages from
the office of the prison to the different apartments. Invariably our
friends, they surreptitiously conveyed notes to acquaintances in the
other rooms, and often to Unionists outside.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Negro Cruelly Whipped.</div>

<p>While we were at Libby, an intelligent mulatto prisoner from
Philadelphia was whipped for some trivial offense. His piercing
shrieks followed each application of the lash; one of my messmates,
who counted them, stated that he received three hundred and
twenty-seven blows. A month afterward I examined his back, and found
it still gridironed with scars.</p>

<p>At the Castle the negroes frequently received from five to
twenty-five lashes. I saw boys not more than eight years old turned
over a barrel and cowhided. One woman upward of sixty was whipped in
the same manner. This negress was known as "Old Sally;" she earned a
good deal of Confederate money by washing for prisoners, and spent
nearly the whole of it in purchasing supplies for unfortunates who
were without means. She had been confined in different prisons for
nearly three years.</p>

<p>The next oldest inmate was a Little Dorrit of a cur, born and
raised in the Castle. Notwithstanding her life-long associations,
she manifested the usual canine antipathy toward negroes and
tatterdemalions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Execution of Spencer Kellogg.</div>

<p>Soon after our arrival, Spencer Kellogg, of Philadelphia, one of
our fellow-prisoners, was executed as a Yankee spy. He had been in
the secret service of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
United States, but belonged to the western navy at the time of his
capture. He bore himself with great coolness and self-possession,
assuring the Rebels that he was glad to die for his country. On the
scaffold he did not manifest the slightest tremor. While the rope was
being adjusted, he accidentally knocked off the hat of a bystander,
to whom he turned and said, with great suavity: "I beg your pardon,
sir."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Steadfastness of Southern Unionists.</div>

<p>The loyalty of the southern Unionists was intense. One Tennessean,
whose hair was white with age, was taken before Major Carrington, the
Provost-Marshal, who said to him:</p>

<p>"You are so old that I have concluded to send you home, if you
will take the oath."</p>

<p>"Sir," replied the prisoner, "if you knew me personally, I should
think you meant to insult me. I have lived seventy years, and, God
helping me, I will not now do an act to embitter the short remnant
of my life, and one which I should regret through eternity. I have
four boys in the Union army; they all went there by my advice. Were I
young enough to carry a musket I would be with them to-day fighting
against the Rebellion."</p>

<p>The sturdy old Loyalist at last died in prison.</p>

<p>There were many kindred cases. Nearly all the men of this class
confined with us were from mountain regions of the South. Many were
ragged, all were poor. They very seldom heard from their families.
They were compelled to live solely upon the prison rations, often a
perpetual compromise with starvation. Some had been in confinement
for two or three years, and their homes desolated and burned. Unlike
the North, they knew what war meant.</p>

<p>Yet the lamp of their loyalty burned with inextinguishable
brightness. They never denounced the Government,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
which sometimes neglected them to a criminal degree. They never
desponded, through the gloomiest days, when imbecility in the Cabinet
and timidity in the field threatened to ruin the Union Cause. They
seldom yielded an iota of principle to their keepers. Hungry, cold,
and naked&mdash;waiting, waiting, waiting, through the slow months
and years&mdash;often sick, often dying, they continued true as
steel. History has few such records of steadfast devotion. Greet it
reverently with uncovered head, as the Holy of Holies in our temple
of Patriotism! </p>

<div class="sidenote">A Waggish Journalist.</div>

<p>We consumed many of the long hours in conversing, reading, and
whist-playing. Night after night we strolled wearily up and down our
narrow room, ignorant of the outer world, save through glimpses,
caught from the barred windows, of the clear blue sky and the pitying
stars.</p>

<p>Still, endeavoring to make the best of it, we were often mirthful
and boisterous. Two correspondents of <cite>The Herald</cite>, Mr. S.
T. Bulkley and Mr. L. A. Hendrick, were partners in our captivity.
Hendrick's irrepressible waggery never slept. One evening a Virginia
ruralist, whose intellect was not of the brightest, was brought in
for some violation of Confederate law. After pouring his sorrows into
the sympathetic ear of the correspondent, he suddenly asked:</p>

<p>"What are you here for?"</p>

<p>"I am the victim," replied Hendrick, "of gross and flagrant
injustice. I am the inventor of a new piece of artillery known as the
Hendrick gun. Its range far exceeds every other cannon in the world.
A week ago I was testing it from the Richmond defenses, where it is
mounted. One of its shots accidentally struck and sunk a blockade
runner just entering the port of Wilmington. It was not my fault. I
didn't aim at the steamer. I was just trying the gun for the benefit
of the country. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
these confounded Richmond authorities insisted upon it that I should
pay for the vessel. I told them I would see them ------ first, and
they shut me up in Castle Thunder; but I never will pay in the
world."</p>

<p>"You are quite right. I would not, if I were you," replied the
innocent Virginian. "It is the greatest outrage I ever heard of."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proceedings of a Mock Court.</div>

<p>A fellow-prisoner had been elected commissary of our room, to
divide and distribute the rations. One evening a court was organized
to try him for "malfeasance in office." The indictment charged that
he issued soup only when he ought to issue meat&mdash;stealing the
beef and selling it for his personal benefit. One correspondent
appeared as prosecuting attorney, another as counsel for the defense,
and a third as presiding judge.</p>

<p>An extract from a Richmond journal being objected to as testimony,
it was decided that any thing published by any newspaper must
necessarily be true, and was competent evidence in that court. A
great deal of remarkable law was cited in Greek, Latin, German, and
French. Counsel were fined for contempt of court, jurors placed under
arrest for going to sleep. When the spectators became boisterous,
the sheriff was ordered to clear the court-room, and, during certain
testimony, the judge requested that the ladies withdraw.</p>

<p>The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and, after being harangued
in touching terms upon the enormity of his offense, the culprit was
sentenced to eat a quart of his own soup at a single meal. It was an
hilarious affair for that loathsome place, which swarmed with vermin,
and where the silence was broken nightly by the clanking and rattling
of the chains of convicts.</p>

<p>Many prison inmates exhibited daring and ingenuity in attempting
to escape. Castle Thunder was vigilantly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
and securely guarded, with a score of sentinels inside, and a cordon
of sentinels without.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Escape by Killing a Guard.</div>

<p>In the condemned cell adjoining our room was a Rebel officer named
Booth, with three comrades, under sentence of death on charge of
murder. All were heavily ironed. Nightly, as the time appointed for
their execution approached, they surprised us by dancing, rattling
their chains, and singing. At one o'clock on the morning of October
22d, we were awakened by shouts and musket-shots. The whole Castle
was alarmed, and the guard turned out.</p>

<p>With a saw made from a case-knife, Booth had cut a hole through
the floor of his cell, his comrades the while singing and dancing
to drown the noise. They were compelled to be very cautious, as a
sentinel paced within six feet of them, under instructions to watch
them closely. Filing off their irons, they descended cautiously
through the aperture into a store-room, where they found four
muskets. In the darkness they removed the lock from the door, and
each taking a gun, crept into another room opening to the street;
struck down the sentinel, and felled a second with the butt of a
musket, knocking him ten or twelve feet. At the outer door, a guard,
who had taken the alarm, presented his gun. Before he could fire,
Booth shot him fatally through the head.</p>

<p>The three late prisoners ran up the street, several ineffectual
shots being fired after them by the guards, who dared not leave their
posts. At the long bridge across the James River they knocked down
another sentinel, who attempted to stop them. Traveling by night
through the woods, they soon reached the Union lines.</p>

<p>A considerable number of prisoners smeared their faces with
croton-oil to produce eruptions. The surgeon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
called in at exactly the right stage, pronounced the disease
small-pox. They were driven toward the small-pox hospital in
unguarded ambulances, from which they jumped and ran for their lives.
It was a profound mystery to the physician that patients should be
so agile, until, examining one face after the eruptions began to
subside, he detected the imposition.</p>

<p>In Tennessee two Indiana captains were found within the Rebel
lines. They were actually in the secret service of the Government,
reconnoitering Confederate camps; but they passed themselves off as
deserters, and were brought to the Castle. One told me his story,
adding:</p>

<p>"They offer to release us if we will take the oath of allegiance
to the Southern Confederacy; but I cannot do that. I want to rejoin
my regiment, and fight the Rebels while the war lasts. I must escape,
and I cannot afford to lose any time."</p>

<p>He kept his own counsel; but the next night took up a plank and
descended to a subterranean room, whence he began digging a tunnel.
After several nights' labor, when almost completed, the tunnel was
discovered by the prison authorities. He immediately commenced
another. That also was found, a few hours before it would have proved
a success. Then he tried the croton-oil, and in ten days he was again
under the old flag.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Escape by Playing Negro.</div>

<p>One prisoner, procuring from the negroes a suit of old clothing,
a slouched hat, and a piece of burnt cork, assumed the garments,
and blackened his face. With a bucket in his hand, he followed the
negroes down three flights of stairs and past four sentinels. Hiding
in the negro quarters until after dark, he then leaped from a window
in the very face of a sentinel, but disappeared around a corner
before the soldier could fire. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span></p>

<p>Another was sent to General Winder's office for examination. On
the way he told his stolid guard that he was clerk of the Castle, and
ordered him:</p>

<p>"Go up this street to the next corner and wait there for me. I am
compelled to visit the Provost-Marshal's office. Be sure and wait. I
will meet you in fifteen minutes."</p>

<p>The unsuspecting guard obeyed the order, and the prisoner
leisurely walked off.</p>

<p>Captain Lafayette Jones, of Carter County, Tennessee, was held on
the charge of bushwhacking and recruiting for the Federal army within
the Rebel lines. If brought to trial, he would undoubtedly have been
convicted and shot. He succeeded in deluding the officers of the
prison about his own identity, and was released upon enlisting in the
Rebel army, under the name of Leander Johannes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Escape by Forging a Release.</div>

<p>George W. Hudson, of New York, had been caught in Louisiana, while
acting as a spy in the Union service. Returning to the prison from a
preliminary examination before General Winder, he said:</p>

<p>"They have found all my papers, which were sewn in the lining of
my valise. There is evidence enough to hang me twenty times over. I
have no hope unless I can escape."</p>

<p>He canvassed a number of plans, at last deciding upon one. Then he
remarked, with great nonchalance:</p>

<p>"Well, I am not quite ready yet; I must send out to buy a valise
and get my clothes washed, so that I can leave in good shape."</p>

<p>Three or four days later, having completed these arrangements,
he wrote an order for his own discharge, forging General Winder's'
signature. It was a close imitation of Winder's genuine papers upon
which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
prisoners were discharged daily. Hudson employed a negro to leave
this document, unobserved, upon the desk of the prison Adjutant. Just
then I was confined in a cell for an attempt to escape. One morning
some one tapped at my door; looking out through the little aperture,
I saw Hudson, valise in hand, with the warden behind him.</p>

<p>"I have come to say good-by. My discharge has arrived." (In a
whisper,) "Put your ear up here. My plan is working to a charm. It is
the prettiest thing you ever saw."</p>

<p>He bade me adieu, conversed a few minutes with the prison
officers, and walked leisurely up the street. A Union lady sheltered
him, and when the Rebels next heard of Hudson he was with the Army of
the Potomac, serving upon the staff of General Meade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Escaped Prisoner at Jeff. Davis's Levee.</div>

<p>Robert Slocum, of the Nineteenth Massachusetts Volunteers, was
taken to Richmond as a prisoner of war. In two days he escaped, and
procured, from friendly negroes, citizen's clothing. Then passing
himself off as an Englishman recently arrived in America by a
blockade-runner, he attempted to leave the port of Wilmington for
Nassau. Through some informality in his passport, he was arrested
and lodged in Castle Thunder. Employing an attorney, he secured
his release. Still adhering to the original story, he remained in
Richmond for many months. He frequently sent us letters, supplies,
and provisions, and made many attempts to aid us in escaping. One day
he wrote me an entertaining description of President Davis's levee,
at which he had spent the previous evening. </p>

<div class="sidenote">Assistance from a Negro Boy.</div>

<p>Several days of our confinement in Castle Thunder were spent in a
little cell with burglars, thieves, "bounty-jumpers," and confidence
men. Our association with these strange companions happened in this
wise:</p>

<p>One day we completed an arrangement with a corporal of the guard,
by which, with the aid of four of his men, he was to let us out at
midnight. We had a friend in Richmond, but did not know precisely
where his house was situated. We were very anxious to learn, and
fortunately, on this very day, he sent a meal to a prisoner in our
room. Recognizing the plate, I asked the intelligent young Baltimore
negro who brought it:</p>

<p>"Is my friend waiting below?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Can't you get me an opportunity to see him for one moment?"</p>

<p>"I think so, sir. Come with me and we will try."</p>

<p>The boy led me through the passages and down the stairs, past four
guards, who supposed that he had been sent by the prison authorities.
As we reached the lower floor, I saw my friend standing in the
street door, with two officers of the prison beside him. By a look I
beckoned him. He walked toward me and I toward him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
until we met at the little railing which separated us. There, over
the bayonet of the sentinel, this whispered conversation followed:</p>

<p>"We hope to get out to-night; can we find refuge in your
house?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. At what hour will you come?"</p>

<p>"We hope, between twelve and one o'clock. Where is your place?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Prison Officers Enraged.</div>

<p>He told me the street and number. By this time, the Rebel
officers, discovering what was going on, grew indignant and very
profane. They peremptorily ordered my friend into the street. He
went out wearing a look of mild and injured innocence. The negro had
shrewdly slipped out of sight the moment he brought us together, and
thus escaped severe punishment.</p>

<p>The officers ordered me back to my quarters, and as I went up the
stairs, I heard a volley of oaths. They were not especially incensed
at me, recognizing the fact that a prisoner under guard has a right
to do any thing he can; but were indignant and chagrined at that want
of discipline which permitted an inmate of the safest apartment in
the Castle to pass four sentinels to the street door, and converse
with an unauthorized person.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Visit from a Friendly Woman.</div>

<p>Ten minutes after, a boy came up from the office, with the
message&mdash;this time genuine&mdash;that another visitor wished to
see me. I went down, and there, immediately beyond the bars through
which we were allowed to communicate with outsiders, I saw a lady
who called me by name. I did not recognize her, but her eyes told
me that she was a friend. A Rebel officer was standing near, to see
that no improper communication passed between us. She conversed upon
indifferent subjects, but soon found opportunity for saying:</p>

<p>"I am the wife of your friend who has just left you.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
He dared not come again. I succeeded in obtaining admission. I
have a note for you. I cannot give it to you now, for this officer
is looking; but, when I bid you good-by, I will slip it into your
hand."</p>

<p>The letter contained the warmest protestations of friendship,
saying:</p>

<p>"We will do any thing in the world for you. You shall have shelter
at our house, or, if you think that too public, at any house you
choose among our friends. We will find you the best pilot in Richmond
to take you through the lines. We will give you clothing, we will
give you money&mdash;every thing you need. If you wish, we will
send a half dozen young men to steal up in front of the Castle at
midnight; and, for a moment, to throw a blanket over the head of each
of the sentinels who stand beside the door."</p>

<p>At one o'clock that night, the Rebel corporal came to our door and
said, softly:</p>

<p>"All things are ready; I have my four men at the proper posts; we
can pass you to the street without difficulty. Should you meet any
pickets beyond, the countersign for to-night is 'Shiloh.' I know you
all, and implicitly trust you; but some of my men do not, and before
passing out your party of six, they want to see that you have in your
possession the money you propose to give us" (seventy dollars in
United States currency, together with two gold watches).</p>

<p>This request was reasonable, and Bulkley handed his portion of the
money to the corporal. A moment later he returned with it from the
gas-light, and said:</p>

<p>"There is a mistake about this. Here are five one-dollar notes, not
five-dollar notes."</p>

<p>My friend was very confident there was no error; and we were forced
to the conclusion that the guards designed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
to obtain our money without giving us our liberty. So the plan was
baffled.</p>

<p>The next morning proved that the corporal was right. My friend
<em>had</em> offered him the wrong roll of notes. We hoped very shortly to
try again, but considerable finessing was required to get the right
sentinels upon the right posts. Before it could be done we were
placed in a dungeon, on the charge of attempting to escape. We were
kept there ten days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shut up in a Cell.</div>

<p>Our fellows in confinement were the burglars and confidence
men&mdash;"lewd fellows of the baser sort," without principle or
refinement, living by their wits. They frankly related many of
their experiences in enlisting and re-enlisting for large bounties
as substitutes in the Rebel service; decoying negroes from their
masters, and then selling them; stealing horses, etc. But they
treated us with personal courtesy, and though their own rations were
wretchedly short, never molested our dried beef, hams, and other
provisions, which any night they could safely have purloined.</p>

<p>Small-pox was very prevalent during the winter months. An Illinois
prisoner, named Putman, had a remarkable experience. He was first
vaccinated, and two or three days after, attacked with varioloid.
Just as he recovered from that, he was taken with malignant
small-pox, while the vaccine matter was still working in his arm,
which was almost an unbroken sore from elbow to shoulder. In a few
weeks he returned to the prison with pits all over his face as large
as peas. Small-pox patients were sometimes kept in our close room
for two or three days after the eruptions appeared. One of my own
messmates barely survived this disease.</p>

<p>We were allowed to purchase whatever supplies the Richmond market
afforded, and to have our meals prepared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
in the prison kitchen, by paying the old negro who presided there.
These were privileges enjoyed by none of the other inmates.
Supplies commanded very high prices; it was a favorite jest in
the city, that the people had to carry money in their baskets and
bring home marketing in their porte-monnaies. Our mess consisted
of the four correspondents and Mr. Charles Thompson, a citizen
of Connecticut, whose Democratic proclivities, age, and gravity,
invariably elected him spokesman when we wished to communicate with
the prison authorities. As they regarded us with special hostility,
we kept in the back-ground; but Mr. Thompson's quiet tenacity,
which no refusal could dishearten, and the "greenbacks" which no
<span lang="fr">attach&eacute;</span> could resist, secured us many
favors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stealing from Flag-of-Truce Letters.</div>

<p>Northern letters from our own families reached us with
considerable regularity. Those sent by other persons were mostly
withheld. Robert Ould, the Rebel Commissioner of Exchange, with petty
malignity, never permitted one of the many written from <cite>The
Tribune</cite> office to reach us. All inclosures, excepting money,
and sometimes including it, were stolen with uniform consistency. I
finally wrote upon one of my missives, which was to go North:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"Will the person who systematically abstracts newspaper slips,
   babies' pictures, and postage-stamps from my letters, permit the
   inclosed little poem to reach its destination, unless entirely
   certain that it is contraband and dangerous to the public
   service?"</p>
</div>

<p>Apparently a little ashamed, the Rebel censor thereafter ceased
his peculations.</p>

<p>For a time, boxes of supplies from the North were forwarded to
us with fidelity and promptness. Supposing that this could not last
long, we determined to make hay while the sun shone. One day, dining
from the contents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
of a home box, in cutting through the butter, my knife struck
something hard. We sounded, and brought to the surface a little
phial, hermetically sealed. We opened it, and there found
"greenbacks!"</p>

<p>Upon that hint we acted. While it was impossible to obtain letters
from the North, we could always smuggle them thither by exchanged
prisoners, who would sew them up in their clothing, or in some other
manner conceal them. We immediately began to send many orders for
boxes; all but two or three came safely to hand, and "brought forth
butter in a lordly dish." Treasury notes were also sent bound in
covers of books so deftly as to defy detection. One of my messmates
thus received two hundred and fifty dollars in a single Bible. The
supplies of money, obtained in this manner, lasted through nearly all
our remaining imprisonment, and were of infinite service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Paroles Repudiated by the Rebels.</div>

<p>All the prisoners who were taken to Richmond with us had received
identically the same paroles. In every case, except ours, the Rebels
recognized the paroles, and sent the persons holding them through
the lines. But they utterly disregarded ours. We felt it a sort of
duty to keep them occasionally reminded of their solemn, deliberate,
written obligation to us. We first did this through our attorney,
General Humphrey Marshall, of Kentucky. His relations with Robert
Ould were very close. Upon receiving heavy fees in United States
currency, he had secured the release of several citizens, after all
other endeavors failed. The prisoners believed that Ould shared the
fees.</p>

<p>General Marshall made a strong statement of our case in writing,
adding to the application for release:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"I am instructed by these gentlemen not to ask any favors at your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
   hands, but to enforce their clear, legal, unquestionable rights under
   this parole."</p>
</div>

<p>Commissioner Ould indorsed upon this application that he repudiated
the parole altogether. In reporting to us, General Marshall said:</p>

<p>"I don't feel at liberty to accept a fee from you, because I consider
your case hopeless."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sentenced to the Salisbury Prison.</div>

<p>Early in the new year, we addressed a memorial to Mr. Seddon, the
Rebel Secretary of War, in which we attempted to argue the case upon
its legal merits, and to prove what a flagrant, atrocious violation
of official faith was involved in our detention. We plumed ourselves
a good deal on our legal logic, but Mr. Seddon returned a very
convincing refutation of our argument. He simply wrote an order that
we be sent to the Rebel penitentiary at Salisbury, North Carolina,
to be held until the end of the war, as hostages for Rebel citizens
confined in the North, and for the general good conduct of our
Government toward them!</p>

<p>Like the historic Roman, content to be refuted by an emperor who
was master of fifty legions, we yielded gracefully to the argument
of the Secretary who had the whole Confederate army at his back; and
thus we were sent to Salisbury.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"<span class="smcap">Abolitionists Before the
War.</span>"</div>

<p>On the night before our departure, the warden, a Maryland refugee,
named Wiley, ordered us below into a very filthy apartment, to be
ready for the morning train. We appealed to Captain Richardson,
Commandant of the Castle, who, countermanding the order, permitted
us to remain in our own more comfortable quarters during the night.
Ten minutes after, one of the little negroes came to our room, and,
beckoning me to bend down, he whispered:</p>

<p>"What do you think Mr. Wiley says about Captain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
Richardson's letting you stay here to-night? As soon as the Captain
went out, he said: 'It's a shame for Richardson and Browne to receive
so many more favors than the other prisoners. Why, ---- ---- them,
they were Abolitionists before the war!'"</p>

<p>On the way to Salisbury we were very closely guarded, but there
were many times during the night when we might easily have jumped
from the car window.</p>

<p>At Raleigh, a pleasant little city of five thousand people, named
in honor of the great Sir Walter, the temptation was very strong. In
the confusion and darkness through which we passed from one train to
another, we might easily have eluded the guards; but we were feeble,
a long distance from our army lines, and quite unfamiliar with the
country. It was a golden opportunity neglected; for it is always
comparatively easy for captives to escape while <span lang="la">in
transitu</span>, and very difficult when once within the walls of a
military prison.</p>

<p>On the evening of February 3d we reached Salisbury, and were taken
to the Confederate States Penitentiary. It was a brick structure, one
hundred feet by forty, four stories in hight, originally erected for
a cotton-factory. In addition to the main building, there were six
smaller ones of brick, which had formerly been tenement houses; and
a new frame hospital, with clean hay mattresses for forty patients.
The buildings, which would hold about five hundred prisoners, were
all filled. Confederate convicts, Yankee deserters, about twenty
enlisted men of our navy and three United States officers confined
as hostages, one hundred and fifty Southern Unionists, and fifty
northern citizens, composed the inmates. </p>

</div>

<p>Truly saith the Italian proverb, "There are no ugly loves and no
handsome prisons." Still we found Salisbury comparatively endurable.
Captain Swift Galloway, commanding, though a hearty Confederate, was
kind and courteous to the captives. Our sleeping apartment, crowded
with uncleanly men, and foul with the vilest exhalations, was filthy
and vermin-infested beyond description. No northern farmer, fit to be
a northern farmer, would have kept his horse or his ox in it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Open Air and Pure Water.</div>

<p>But the yard of four acres, like some old college grounds, with
great oak trees and a well of sweet, pure water, was open to us
during the whole day. There, the first time for nine months, our
feet pressed the mother earth, and the blessed open air fanned our
cheeks.</p>

<p>Mr. Luke Blackmer, of Salisbury, kindly placed his library of
several thousand volumes at our disposal. Whenever we wished for
books we had only to address a note to him, through the prison
authorities, and, in a few hours, a little negro with a basket of
them on his head would come in at the gate. It seemed more like life
and less like the tomb than any prison we had inhabited before.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Crushing Weight of Imprisonment.</div>

<p>And yet those long Summer months were very dreary to bear, for we
had upon us the one heavy, crushing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
weight of captivity. It is not hunger or cold, sickness or death,
which makes prison life so hard to bear. But it is the utter
idleness, emptiness, aimlessness of such a life. It is being, through
all the long hours of each day and night&mdash;for weeks, months,
years, if one lives so long&mdash;absolutely without employment,
mental or physical&mdash;with nothing to fill the vacant mind, which
always becomes morbid and turns inward to prey upon itself.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>What exile from his country Can flee himself as well?</p></div>

<p>It was doubtless this which gave us the look peculiar to the
captive&mdash;the disturbed, half-wild expression of the eye, the
contraction of the wrinkled brow which indicates trouble at the
heart.</p>

<p>We were most struck with this in the morning, when, on first going
out of our sleeping quarters, we passed down by the hospital and
stopped beside the bench where those were laid who had died during
the night. As we lifted the cloth, to see who had found release, the
one thing which always impressed me was the perfect calm, the sweet,
ineffable peace, which those white, thin faces wore. For months I
never saw it without a twinge of envy. Until then I never felt the
meaning of the words, "where the wicked cease from troubling and the
weary are at rest." Until then I never realized the wealth of the
assurance, "He giveth his beloved sleep."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bad News from Home.</div>

<p>Some prisoners had an additional weight to bear. They were
southern Unionists&mdash;Tennesseans, North Carolinians, West
Virginians, and Mississippians&mdash;whose families lived on the
border. They knew that they were liable any day to have their houses
robbed or burned by the enemy, and their wives and little ones turned
out to the mercy of the elements, or the charity of friends.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
This gnawing anxiety took away their elasticity and power of
endurance. They had far less capacity for resisting disease and
hardship than the northeners, and died in the proportion of four or
five to one. I could hardly wonder at the fervor with which, in their
devotional exercises, night after night, they sung the only hymn
which they ever attempted:</p>

<div class="poem">
   <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i0">"There I shall bathe my weary soul</span>
      <span class="i2">In seas of heavenly rest;</span>
      <span class="i0">And not a wave of trouble roll</span>
      <span class="i2">Across this peaceful breast."</span>
   </div>
</div>

<p>The cup of others, yet, had a still bitterer ingredient, which
filled it to overflowing. I wonder profoundly that any one drinking
of it ever lived to tell his story. They had received bad news from
home&mdash;news that those nearest and dearest, finding their load
of life too heavy, had laid it wearily down. During the long prison
hours, such had nothing to think of but the vacant place, the hushed
voice, and the desolate hearth. Hope&mdash;the one thing which
buoys up the prisoner&mdash;was gone. That picture of home, which
had looked before as heaven looks to the enthusiastic devotee, was
forever darkened. The prisoner knew if the otherwise glad hour of
his release should ever come, no warmth of welcome, no greeting of
friendship, no rejoicing of affection, could ever replace for him the
infinite value of the love he had lost.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Great Libby Tunnel.</div>

<p>Early in the Spring we were delighted to learn from Richmond that
Colonel Streight had succeeded in escaping from Libby. The officers
constructed a long tunnel, which proved a perfect success, liberating
one hundred and fourteen of them. Streight, whose proportions tended
toward the Falstaffian, was very apprehensive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
that he could not work his way through it. Narrowly escaping the fate
of the greedy fox which "stuck in the hole," he finally squeezed
through. The Rebels hated him so bitterly that, by the unanimous
wish of his fellow-prisoners, he was the first man to pass out. A
Union woman of Richmond concealed him for nearly two weeks. The
first officers who reached our lines announced through the New York
papers that Streight had arrived at Fortress Monroe. This caused the
Richmond authorities to relinquish their search; and finally, under
a skillful pilot, having traveled with great caution for eleven
nights to accomplish less than a hundred miles, Streight reached the
protection of the Stars and Stripes.</p>

<p>Our prison rations of corn bread and beef were tolerable,
in quantity and quality. The Salisbury market also afforded a
few articles, of which eggs were the great staple. We indulged
extravagantly in that mild form of dissipation&mdash;our mess of five
at one time having on hand seventy-two dozen, which represented, in
Confederate currency, about two hundred dollars.</p>

<p>We soon made the acquaintance of several loyal North Carolinians.
Citizens of respectability were permitted to visit the prison. Those
of Union proclivities invariably found opportunity to converse with
us. Like all Loyalists of the South, white and black, they trusted
northern prisoners implicitly. The reign of terror was so great that
they often feared to repose confidence in each other, and cautioned
us against repeating their expressions of loyalty to their neighbors
and friends, whose Union sympathies were just as strong as theirs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Horrible Sufferings of Union Officers.</div>

<p>Captains Julius L. Litchfield, of the Fourth Maine Infantry,
Charles Kendall, of the Signal Corps, and Edward E. Chase, of the
First Rhode Island Cavalry, were imprisoned in the upper room of the
factory. Held as hostages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
for certain Rebel officers in the Alton, Illinois,
penitentiary, they were sentenced to confinement and hard labor
during the war. In one instance only was the hard labor imposed. In
the prison yard they were ordered to remove several heavy stones
a few yards and then carry them back. For some minutes they stood
beside the Rebel sergeant, silently and with folded arms. Then Chase
thus instructed the guard:</p>

<p>"Go to Captain Galloway, and tell him, with my compliments, that
perhaps I was just as delicately nurtured as he&mdash;that, if he were in
my place, he would hardly do this work, and that I will see the whole
Confederacy in the Bottomless Pit before I lift a single stone!"</p>

<p>Chase and his comrades were never afterward ordered to labor.
Other Union officers, held as hostages, arrived from time to time.
Eight, who came from Richmond, had been confined one hundred
and forty-five days in that horrible Libby cell where the mold
accumulated on the beard of the Pennsylvania lieutenant. While there
they suffered intensely from cold, ate daily all their scanty ration
the moment it was issued, and were compelled to fast for the rest
of the twenty-four hours, save when they could catch rats, which
they eagerly devoured. Some came out with broken constitutions, and
all were frightfully pallid and emaciated. Starving and freezing
are words easily said, but these gentlemen learned their actual
significance.</p>

<p>Four of them were held for Kentucky bushwhackers, whom one of our
military courts had sentenced to death, which they clearly deserved
under well-defined laws of war. Had they been promptly executed, the
Rebels would never have dared, in retaliation, to hurt the hair of a
prisoners head. But Mr. Lincoln's kindness of heart induced him to
commute their sentence to imprisonment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
and made him unwittingly the cause of this barbarity toward our own
officers.</p>

<p>The hostages were plucky and enterprising, frequently attempting
to escape. One night they suspended from their fourth-story window
a rope which they had constructed of blankets. Captain Ives, of the
Tenth Massachusetts Infantry, descended in safety. A daring and loyal
Rebel deserter, from East Tennessee, named Carroll, who designed to
pilot them to our lines, attempted to follow; but the rope broke,
and he fell the whole distance, striking upon his head. It would
have killed most men; but Carroll, after spending the night in the
guard-house, bathed his swollen head and troubled himself no further
about the matter.</p>

<p>Captain B. C. G. Reed, from Zanesville, Ohio, was constantly
trying to secure his own release. It always seemed to make him
unhappy when he passed two or three weeks without making attempts to
escape. They usually resulted in his being hand-cuffed and ballasted
by a ball and chain, or confined in a filthy cell.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Cool Method of Escape.</div>

<p>But, sooner or later, perseverance achieves. Once, while so weak
from inflammatory rheumatism, contracted in a Richmond dungeon, that
he could hardly walk, he made a successful endeavor, in company with
Captain Litchfield. At nine o'clock, on a rainy March night, with
their blankets wrapped about them, they coolly walked up to the gate.
They rebuked the guard who halted them, indignantly asking him if he
did not know that they belonged at head-quarters! Impudence won the
day. The innocent sentinel permitted them to pass. They went directly
through Captain Galloway's office, which fortunately happened to
be empty; reached the outer fence; Litchfield helped over his weak
companion, and the world was all before them, where to choose.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
They traveled one hundred and twenty miles, but, in the mountains of
East Tennessee, were recaptured and brought back.</p>

<p>Nothing daunted, Reed repeated the attempt again and again.
Finally, he jumped from a train of cars in the city of Charleston,
found a negro who secreted him, and by night conveyed him in a skiff
to our forces at Battery Wagner. Reed returned to his command in
Thomas's Army, and was subsequently killed in one of the battles
before Nashville. Entering the service as a private, and fairly
winning promotion, he was an excellent type of the thinking bayonets,
of the young men who freely gave their lives "for our dear country's
sake."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Captured through an Obstinate Mule.</div>

<p>Early in the summer, our mess was agreeably enlarged by the
arrival of Mr. William E. Davis, Correspondent of <cite>The Cincinnati
Gazette</cite> and Clerk of the Ohio Senate. Davis owed his capture to
the stupidity of a mule. Riding leisurely along a road within the
lines of General Sherman's army, more than a mile from the front,
he was compelled to pass through a little gap left between two
corps, which had not quite connected. He was suddenly confronted
by a double-barreled shot-gun, presented by a Rebel standing
behind a tree, who commanded him to halt. Not easily intimidated,
Davis attempted to turn his mule and ride for a life and liberty.
With the true instinct of his race, the animal resisted the rein,
seeming to require a ten-acre lot and three days for turning
around&mdash;wherefore the rider fell into the hands of the
Philistines.</p>

<p>Books whiled away many weary hours. As Edmond Dantes, in the Count of
Monte Christo, came out from his twelve years of imprisonment "a very
well-read man," we ought to have acquired limitless lore; but reading
at last palled upon our tastes, and we would none of it. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Concealing Money when Searched.</div>

<p>Our Salisbury friends supplied us liberally with money. The
editors of the migratory <cite>Memphis Appeal</cite> frequently
offered to me any amount which I might desire, and made many attempts
to secure my exchange.</p>

<p>The prison authorities sometimes searched us; but friendly guards,
or officers of Union proclivities, would always give us timely
notice, enabling us to secrete our money. One (nominally) Rebel
lieutenant, after we were drawn up in line and the searching had
begun, would sometimes receive bank-notes from us, and hand them back
when we were returned to our own quarters.</p>

<p>Once, as we were being examined, I had forty dollars, in United
States currency, concealed in my hat. That was an article of dress
which had never been examined. But now, looking down the line, I saw
the guard suddenly commence taking off the prisoners' hats, carefully
scrutinizing them. Removing the money from mine, I handed it to
Lieutenant Holman, of Vermont; but, turning around, I observed that
two Rebel officers immediately behind us had witnessed the movement.
Holman promptly passed the notes to "Junius," who stood near, reading
a ponderous volume, and who placed them between the leaves of his
book. Holman was at once taken from the line and searched rigorously
from head to foot, but the Rebels were unable to find the coveted
"greenbacks."</p>

<p>The prison officers, under rigid orders from the Richmond
authorities, would sometimes retain money received by mail. Two
hundred dollars in Confederate notes were thus withheld from me for
more than a year. Determined that the Rebel officials should not
enjoy much peace of mind, I addressed them letter after letter,
reciting their various subterfuges. At last, upon my demanding that
they should either give me the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
money, or refuse positively over their own signatures, the amount
was forthcoming. Thousands of dollars belonging to prisoners were
confiscated upon frivolous pretexts, or no pretext whatever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempts to Escape Frustrated.</div>

<p>Persistent ill-fortune still followed all our attempts to escape.
Once we perfected an arrangement with a friendly guard, by which, at
midnight, he was to pass us over the fence upon his beat. Before our
quarters were locked for the night, "Junius" and myself hid under
the hospital, where, through the faithful sentinel, escape would be
certain. But just then, we chanced to be nearly without money, and
Davis waited for a Union <span lang="fr">attach&eacute;</span> of the
prison to bring him four hundred dollars from a friend outside. The
messenger, for the first and last time in eleven months, becoming
intoxicated that afternoon, arrived with the money five minutes too
late. Davis was unable to join us; we determined not to leave him,
expecting to repeat the attempt on the following night; but the next
day the guard was conscribed and sent to Lee's army.</p>

<p>These constant failures subjected us to many jests from our
fellow-prisoners. Once, in a dog-day freak, "Junius" had every
hair shaved from his head, leaving his pallid face diversified
only by a great German mustache. He replied to all <span
lang="fr">badinage</span> that he was not the correspondent for whom
his interlocutors mistook him, but the venerable and famous Chinaman
"No-Go."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Yankee Deserters Whipped and Hanged.</div>

<p>The Yankee deserters, having no friends to protect them, were
treated with great harshness. During a single day six were tied up to
a post and received, in the aggregate, one hundred and twenty-seven
lashes with the cat-o'nine-tails upon their bare backs, as punishment
for digging a tunnel. Many of them were "bounty-jumpers" and
desperadoes. They robbed each newly-arriving

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
deserter of all his money, beating him unmercifully if he resisted.
After being thus whipped, at their own request their <span
lang="la">status</span> was changed, and they were sent as prisoners
of war to Andersonville, Georgia. There the Union prisoners,
detecting them in several robberies and murders, organized a
court-martial, tried them, and hung six of them upon trees within the
garrison, with ropes furnished by the Rebel commandant.</p>

<p>For seven months no letters, even from our own families, were
permitted to reach us. This added much to our weariness. I never knew
the pathos of Sterne's simple story until I heard "Junius" read it
one sad Summer night in our prison quarters. For weeks afterward rung
in my ears the cry of the poor starling: "I can't get out! I can't
get out!" </p>

<div class="sidenote">Great Influx of Prisoners.</div>

<p>Early in October, the condition of the Salisbury garrison suddenly
changed. Nearly ten thousand prisoners of war, half naked and without
shelter, were crowded into its narrow limits, which could not
reasonably accommodate more than six hundred. It was converted into
a scene of suffering and death which no pen can adequately describe.
For every hour, day and night, we were surrounded by horrors which
burned into our memories like a hot iron.</p>

<p>We had never before been in a prison containing our private
soldiers. In spite of many assurances to the contrary, we had been
skeptical as to the barbarities which they were said to suffer
at Belle Isle and Andersonville. We could not believe that men
bearing the American name would be guilty of such atrocities. Now,
looking calmly upon our last two months in Salisbury, it seems
hardly possible to exaggerate the incredible cruelty of the Rebel
authorities.</p>

<p>When captured, the prisoners were robbed of the greater part of
their clothing. When they reached Salisbury, all were thinly clad,
thousands were barefooted, not one in twenty had an overcoat or
blanket, and many hundreds were without coats or blouses. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Starving in the Midst of Food.</div>

<p>For several weeks, they were furnished with no shelter whatever.
Afterward, one Sibley tent and one A tent was issued to each hundred
men. With the closest crowding, these contained about one-half of
them. The rest burrowed in the earth, crept under buildings, or
dragged out the nights in the open air upon the muddy, snowy, or
frozen ground. In October, November, and December, snow fell several
times. It was piteous beyond description to see the poor fellows,
coatless, hatless, and shoeless, shivering about the yard.</p>

<p>They were organized into divisions of one thousand each, and
subdivided into squads of one hundred. Almost daily one or more
divisions was without food for twenty-four hours. Several times some
of them received no rations for forty-eight hours. The few who had
money, paid from five to twenty dollars, in Rebel currency, for a
little loaf of bread. Some sold the coats from their backs and the
shoes from their feet to purchase food.</p>

<p>When a subordinate asked the post-Commandant, Major John H. Gee,
"Shall I give the prisoners full rations?" he replied: "No, G-d d--n
them, give them quarter-rations!"</p>

<p>Yet, at this very time, one of our Salisbury friends, a trustworthy
and Christian gentleman, assured us, in a stolen interview:</p>

<p>"It is within my personal knowledge that the great commissary
warehouse, in this town, is filled to the roof with corn and pork. I
know that the prison commissary finds it difficult to obtain storage
for his supplies."</p>

<p>After our escape, we learned from personal observation that the
region abounded in corn and pork. Salisbury was a general d&eacute;p&ocirc;t for
army supplies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Freezing in the Midst of Fuel.</div>

<p>That section of country is densely wooded. The cars
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
brought fuel to the door of our prison. If the Rebels were short of
tents, they might easily have paroled two or three hundred prisoners,
to go out and cut logs, with which, in a single week, barracks could
have been constructed for every captive; but the Commandant would not
consent. He did not even furnish half the needed fuel.</p>

<p>Cold and hunger began to tell fearfully upon the robust young
men, fresh from the field, who crowded the prison. Sickness was very
prevalent and very fatal. It invariably appeared in the form of
pneumonia, catarrh, diarrh&oelig;a, or dysentery; but was directly
traceable to freezing and starvation. Therefore the medicines were of
little avail. The weakened men were powerless to resist disease, and
they were carried to the dead-house in appalling numbers.</p>

<p>By appointment of the prison authorities, my two comrades and
myself were placed in charge of all the hospitals, nine in number,
inside the garrison. The scenes which constantly surrounded us were
enough to shake the firmest nerves; but there was work to be done
for the relief of our suffering companions. We could accomplish very
little&mdash;hardly more than to give a cup of cold water, and see
that the patients were treated with sympathy and kindness.</p>

<p>Mr. Davis was general superintendent, and brought to his arduous
duties good judgment, untiring industry, and uniform kindness.</p>

<p>"Junius" was charged with supplying medicines to the "out-door
patients." The hospitals, when crowded, would hold about six hundred;
but there were always many more invalids unable to obtain admission.
These wretched men waited wearily for death in their tents, in
subterranean holes, under hospitals, or in the open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
air. My comrade's tender sympathy softened the last hours of many a
poor fellow who had long been a stranger to</p>

<div class="poem">
   <div class="stanza">

      <span class="i0">Or the stray sunshine of a smile."</span>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Rebel Surgeons Generally Humane.</div>

<p>I was appointed to supervise all the hospital books, keeping a
record of each patient's name, disease, admission, and discharge
or death. At my own solicitation, the Rebel surgeon-in-chief also
authorized me to receive the clothing left by the dead, and re-issue
it among the living. I endeavored to do this systematically, keeping
lists of the needy, who indeed were nine-tenths of all the prisoners.
The deaths ranged from twenty to forty-eight daily, leaving many
garments to be distributed. Day after day, in bitterly cold weather,
pale, fragile boys, who should have been at home with their mothers
and sisters, came to me with no clothing whatever, except a pair of
worn cotton pantaloons and a thin cotton shirt.</p>

<p>Dr. Richard O. Currey, a refugee from Knoxville, was the surgeon
in charge. Though a genuine Rebel, he was just and kind-hearted,
doing his utmost to change the horrible condition of affairs. Again
and again he sent written protests to Richmond, which brought several
successive inspectors to examine the prison and hospitals, but no
change of treatment.</p>

<p>We were reluctantly driven to the belief that the Richmond
authorities deliberately adopted this plan to reduce the strength of
our armies. The Medusa head of Slavery had turned their hearts to
stone. At this time, they held nearly forty thousand prisoners. In
our garrison the inmates were dying at the rate of thirteen per cent.
a month upon the aggregate. About as many more were enlisting in the
Rebel army. Thus our soldiers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
were destroyed at the rate of more than twenty-five per cent. a
month, with no corresponding loss to the enemy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Terrible Scenes in the Hospitals.</div>

<p>Frequently, for two or three days, Dr. Currey would refrain from
entering the garrison, reluctant to look upon the revolting scenes
from which <em>we</em> could find no escape. I am glad to be able to throw
one ray of light into so dark a picture. Nearly all the surgeons
evinced that humanity which ought to characterize their profession.
They were much the best class of Rebels we encountered. They
denounced unsparingly the manner in which prisoners were treated, and
endeavored to mitigate their sufferings.</p>

<p>To call the foul pens, where the patients were confined,
"hospitals," was a perversion of the English tongue. We could not
obtain brooms to keep them clean; we could not get cold water to wash
the hands and faces of those sick and dying men. In that region,
where every farmer's barn-yard contained grain-stacks, we could
not procure clean straw enough to place under them. More than half
the time they were compelled to lie huddled upon the cold, naked,
filthy floors, without even that degree of warmth and cleanliness
usually afforded to brutes. The wasted forms and sad, pleading
eyes of those sufferers, waiting wearily for the tide of life to
ebb away&mdash;without the commonest comforts, without one word of
sympathy, or one tear of affection&mdash;will never cease to haunt
me.</p>

<p>At all hours of the day and night, on every side, we heard the
terrible hack! hack! hack! in whose pneumonic tones every prisoner
seemed to be coughing his life away. It was the most fearful sound in
that fearful place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Rattling Dead-Cart.</div>

<p>The last scene of all was the dead-cart, with its rigid forms
piled upon each other like logs&mdash;the arms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
swaying, the white ghastly faces staring, with dropped jaws and stony
eyes&mdash;while it rattled along, bearing its precious freight just
outside the walls, to be thrown in a mass into trenches and covered
with a little earth.</p>

<p>When received, there were no sick or wounded men among the
prisoners. But before they had been in Salisbury six weeks, "Junius,"
with better facilities for knowing than any one else, insisted that
among eight thousand there were not five hundred well men. The Rebel
surgeons coincided in this belief.</p>

<p>The rations, issued very irregularly, were insufficient to support
life. Men grew feeble before living upon them a single week; but
could not buy food from the town; and were not permitted to receive
even a meal sent by friends from the outside. Our positions in the
hospitals enabled us to purchase supplies and fare better. Prisoners
eagerly devoured the potato-skins from our table. They ate rats,
dogs, and cats. Many searched the yard for bones and scraps among the
most revolting substances.</p>

<p>They constantly besieged us for admission to the hospitals, or
for shelter and food, which we were unable to give. It seemed almost
sinful for us to enjoy protection from the weather and food enough to
support life in the midst of all this distress.</p>

<p>On wet days the mud was very deep, and the shoeless wretches
wallowed pitifully through it, seeking vainly for cover and warmth.
Two hundred negro prisoners were almost naked, and could find no
shelter whatever except by burrowing in the earth. The authorities
treated them with unusual rigor, and guards murdered them with
impunity.</p>

<p>No song, no athletic game, few sounds of laughter broke the
silence of the garrison. It was a Hall of Eblis&mdash;devoid of its
gold-besprinkled pavements, crystal vases, and dazzling saloons; but
with all its oppressive silence, livid lips, sunken eyes, and ghastly
figures, at whose hearts the consuming fire was never quenched. </p>

<p>Constant association with suffering deadened our sensibilities. We
were soon able to pass through the hospitals little moved by their
terrible spectacles, except when patients addressed us, exciting a
personal interest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Credulity of our Government.</div>

<p>The credulity and trustfulness of our Government toward the enemy
passed belief. Month after month it sent by the truce-boats many tons
of private boxes for Union prisoners, while the Rebels, not satisfied
with their usual practice of stealing a portion under the rose, upon
one trivial pretext or other, openly confiscated every pound of them.
At the same time, returning truce-boats were loaded with boxes sent
to Rebel prisoners from their friends in the South, and express-lines
crowded with supplies from their sympathizers in the North.</p>

<p>The Government held a large excess of prisoners, and the Rebels
were anxious to exchange man for man; but our authorities acted upon
the cold-blooded theory of Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War, that
we could not afford to give well-fed, rugged men, for invalids and
skeletons&mdash;that returned prisoners were infinitely more valuable
to the Rebels than to us, because their soldiers were inexorably kept
in the army, while many of ours, whose terms of service had expired,
would not re-enlist.</p>

<p>The private soldier who neglects his duty is taken out and shot.
Officials seemed to forget that the soldier's obligation of obedience
devolves upon the Government the obligation of protection. It was
clearly the duty of our authorities either to exchange our own
soldiers, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
to protect them&mdash;not by indiscriminate cruelty, but by
well-considered, systematic retaliation in kind, until the Richmond
authorities should treat prisoners with ordinary humanity. It was
very easy to select a number of Rebel officers, corresponding to the
Union prisoners in the Salisbury garrison, and give them precisely
the same kind and amount of food, clothing, and shelter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General Butler's Example of Retaliation.</div>

<p>When the Confederate Government placed certain of our negro
prisoners under fire, at work upon the fortifications of Richmond,
General Butler, in a brief letter, informed them that he had
stationed an equal number of Rebel officers, equally exposed and
spade in hand, upon <em>his</em> fortifications. When his letter reached
Richmond, before that day's sun went down, the negroes were returned
to Libby Prison and ever afterward treated as prisoners of war. But,
by the mawkish sensibilities of a few northern statesmen and editors,
our Government was encouraged to neglect the matter, and thus
permitted the needless murder of its own soldiers&mdash;a stain upon
the nation's honor, and an inexcusable cruelty to thousands of aching
hearts. </p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempted Outbreak and Massacre.</div>

<p>On the 26th of November, while we were sitting at dinner, John
Lovell came up from the yard and whispered me:</p>

<p>"There is to be an insurrection. The prisoners are preparing to
break out."</p>

<p>We had heard similar reports so frequently as to lose all faith in
them; but this was true. Without deliberation or concert of action,
upon the impulse of the moment, a portion of the prisoners acted.
Suffering greatly from hunger, many having received no food for
forty-eight hours, they said:</p>

<p>"Let us break out of this horrible place. We may just as well die
upon the guns of the guards as by slow starvation."</p>

<p>A number, armed with clubs, sprang upon a Rebel relief of sixteen
men, just entering the yard. Though weak and emaciated, these
prisoners performed their part promptly and gallantly. Man for man,
they wrenched the guns from the soldiers. One Rebel resisted and was
bayoneted where he stood. Instantly, the building against which he
leaned was reddened by a great stain of blood. Another raised his
musket, but, before he could fire, fell to the ground, shot through
the head.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
Every gun was taken from the terrified relief, who immediately ran
back to their camp, outside.</p>

<p>Had parties of four or five hundred then rushed at the fence in
half a dozen different places, they might have confused the guards,
and somewhere made an opening. But some thousands ran to it at
one point only. Having neither crow-bars nor axes they could not
readily effect a breach. At once every musket in the garrison was
turned upon them. Two field-pieces opened with grape and canister.
The insurrection&mdash;which had not occupied more than three
minutes&mdash;was a failure, and the uninjured at once returned to
their quarters.</p>

<p>The yard was now perfectly quiet. The portion of it which we
occupied was several hundred yards from the scene of the <span
lang="fr">m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</span>. In our vicinity there had been
no disturbance whatever; yet the guards stood upon the fence for
twenty minutes, with deliberate aim firing into the tents, upon
helpless and innocent men. Several prisoners were killed within a
dozen yards of our building. One was wounded while leaning against
it. The bullets rattled against the logs, but none chanced to pass
through the wide apertures between them, and enter our apartment.
Sixteen prisoners were killed and sixty wounded, of whom not one in
ten had participated in the outbreak; while most were ignorant of it
until they heard the guns.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cold-Blooded Murders Frequent.</div>

<p>After this massacre, cold-blooded murders were very frequent. Any
guard, standing upon the fence, at any hour of the day or night,
could deliberately raise his musket and shoot into any group of
prisoners, black or white, without the slightest rebuke from the
authorities. He would not even be taken off his post for it.</p>

<p>One Union officer was thus killed when there could be no pretext
that he was violating any prison rule. </p>

<p>Moses Smith, a negro soldier of the Seventh Maryland Infantry,
was shot through the head while standing inoffensively beside my own
quarters, conversing with John Lovell. One of many instances was
that of two white Connecticut soldiers who were shot within their
tents. We induced one of the surgeons to inquire at head-quarters the
cause of the homicide. The answer received was, that the guard saw
three negroes in range, and, knowing he would never have so good an
opportunity again, fired at them, but missed aim and killed the wrong
men! It seemed to be regarded as a harmless jest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hostility to "Tribune" Correspondents.</div>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>Though my comrades and myself, either by <span
   lang="fr">finesse</span> or bribery, often succeeded in obtaining
   special privileges from the prison officers, the hostility of the
   Confederate authorities was unrelenting. Our attorney, Mr. Blackmer,
   after visiting Richmond on our behalf, returned and assured us that
   he saw no hope of our release before the end of the war, unless we
   could effect our escape. Robert Ould, who usually denied that he
   regarded us with special hostility, on one occasion, in his cups,
   remarked to the United States Commissioner:</p>
</div>

<p>"<cite>The Tribune</cite> did more than any other agency to

correspondents. They are just the men we want, and just the men we
are going to hold."</p>

<p>Our Government, through blundering rather than design, released
a large number of Rebel journalists without requiring our exchange.
Finally, while among the horrors of Salisbury, we learned that
Edward A. Pollard, a malignant Rebel, and an editor of <cite>The Richmond
Examiner</cite>, most virulent of all the southern papers, was paroled to
the city of Brooklyn, after confinement for a few weeks in the North.
This news cut us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
like a knife. We, after nearly two years of captivity, in that foul,
vermin-infested prison, among all its atrocities&mdash;he, at large,
among the comforts and luxuries of one of the pleasantest cities in
the world! The thought was so bitter, that, for weeks after hearing
the intelligence, we did not speak of it to each other. Mr. Welles,
Secretary of the Navy, was the person who set Pollard at liberty.
I record the fact, not that any special importance attaches to our
individual experience, but because hundreds of Union prisoners were
subjected to kindred injustice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Cruel Injustice.</div>

<p>At the Salisbury penitentiary was a respectable woman from North
Carolina, who was confined for two months, in the same quarters with
the male inmates. Her crime was, giving a meal to a Rebel deserter!
In Richmond, a Virginian of seventy was shut up with us for a long
time, on the charge of feeding his own son, who had deserted from the
army!</p>

<p>In September, a number of Rebel convicts, armed with clubs and
knives, forcibly took from John Lovell a Union flag, which he had
thus far concealed. After the prisoners of war arrived they vented
their indignation upon the convicts, wherever they could catch them.
For several days, Rebels venturing into the yard were certain to
return to their quarters with bruised faces and blackened eyes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rebel Expectations of Peace.</div>

<p>During the peace mania, which seemed to possess the North, at
the time of McClellan's nomination, the Rebels were very hopeful.
Lieutenant Stockton, the post-Adjutant, one day observed:</p>

<p>"You will go home very soon; we shall have peace within a
month."</p>

<p>"On what do you base your opinion?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The tone of your newspapers and politicians. McClellan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
is certain to be elected President, and peace will immediately
follow."</p>

<p>"You southerners are the most credulous people in the whole world.
You have been so long strangers to freedom of speech and the press,
that you cannot comprehend it at all. There are half a dozen public
men and as many newspapers in the North, who really belong to your
side, and express their Rebel sympathies with little or no disguise.
Can you not see that they never receive any accessions? Point out
a single important convert made by them since the beginning of the
war. Before Sumter, these same men told you that, if we attempted
co&euml;rcion, it would produce war in the North; and you believed
them. Again and again they have told you, as now, that the loyal
States would soon give up the conflict, and you still believe them.
Wait until the people vote, in November, and then tell me what you
think."</p>

<p>In due time came news of Mr. Lincoln's re-election. The prisoners
received it with intense satisfaction. I conveyed it to the Union
officers, from whom we were separated by bayonets&mdash;tossing to
them a biscuit containing a concealed note. A few minutes after,
their cheering and shouting excited the surprise and indignation of
the prison authorities. The next morning I asked Stockton how he now
regarded the peace prospect. Shaking his head, he sadly replied:</p>

<p>"It is too deep for me; I cannot see the end."</p>

<p>A private belonging to the Fifty-ninth Massachusetts Infantry, had
left Boston, a new recruit, just six weeks before we met him. In the
interval he participated in two great battles and five skirmishes,
was wounded in the leg, captured, escaped from his guards, while
<span lang="la">en route</span> for Georgia, traveled three days on
foot, was then

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
re-captured and brought to Salisbury. His six weeks' experience had
been fruitful and varied.</p>

<p>That hope deferred which maketh the heart sick, began to tell
seriously upon our mental health. We grew morbid and bitter, and were
often upon the verge of quarreling among ourselves. I remember even
feeling a pang of jealousy and indignation at an account of some
enjoyment and hilarity among my friends at home.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Prison Like the Tomb.</div>

<p>Our prison was like the tomb. No voice from the North entered its
gloomy portal. Knowing that we had been unjustly neglected by our
own Government, wondering if we were indeed forsaken by God and man,
we seemed to lose all human interest, and to care little whether we
lived or died. But I suppose lurking, unconscious hope, still buoyed
us up. Could we have known positively that we must endure eight
months more of that imprisonment, I think we should have received
with joy and gratitude our sentence to be taken out and shot.</p>

<p>Frequently prisoners asked us, sometimes with tears in their
eyes:</p>

<p>"What shall we do? We grow weaker day by day. Staying here we
shall be certain to follow our comrades to the hospital and the
dead-house. The Rebels assure us that if we will enlist, we shall
have abundant food and clothing; and we may find a chance of escaping
to our own lines."</p>

<p>I always answered that they owed no obligation to God or man to
remain and starve to death. Of the two thousand who did enlist,
nearly all designed to desert at the first opportunity. Their
remaining comrades had no toleration for them. If one who had
joined the Rebels came back into the yard for a moment, his life
was in imminent peril. Two or three times such persons were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
shockingly beaten, and only saved from death by the interference of
the Rebel guards. This ferocity was but the expression of the deep,
unselfish patriotism of our private soldiers. These men, who carried
muskets and received but a mere pittance, were so earnest that they
were almost ready to kill their comrades for joining the enemy even
to escape a slow, torturing death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Something about Tunneling.</div>

<p>We grew very familiar with the occult science of tunneling. Its
<span lang="la">modus operandi</span> is this: the workman, having
sunk a hole in the ground three, six, or eight feet, as the case
may require, strikes off horizontally, lying flat on his face, and
digging with whatever tool he can find&mdash;usually a case-knife.
The excavation is made just large enough for one man to creep through
it. The great difficulty is, to conceal the dirt. In Salisbury,
however, this obstacle did not exist, for many of the prisoners
lived in holes in the ground, which they were constantly changing or
enlarging. Hence the yard abounded in hillocks of fresh earth, upon
which that taken from the tunnels could be spread nightly without
exciting notice.</p>

<p>After the great influx of prisoners of war in October, a large
tunneling business was done. I knew of fifteen in course of
construction at one time, and doubtless there were many more. The
Commandant adopted an ingenious and effectual method of rendering
them abortive.</p>

<p>In digging laterally in the ground, at the distance of thirty or
forty feet the air becomes so foul that lights will not burn, and men
breathe with difficulty. In the great tunnel sixty-five feet long,
by which Colonel Streight and many other officers escaped from Libby
prison, this embarrassment was obviated by a bit of Yankee ingenuity.
The officers, with tacks, blankets, and boards, constructed a pair of
huge bellows, like those used by blacksmiths. Then, while one of them
worked with his case-knife,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
progressing four or five feet in twelve hours, and a second filled
his haversack with dirt and removed it (of course backing out, and
crawling in on his return, as the tunnel was a single track, and had
no turn-table), a third sat at the mouth pumping vigorously, and thus
supplied the workers with fresh air.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Tunnelers Ingeniously Baffled.</div>

<p>At Salisbury this was impracticable. I suppose a paper of tacks
could not have been purchased there for a thousand dollars. There
were none to be had. Of course we could not pierce holes up to the
surface of the ground for ventilation, as that would expose every
thing.</p>

<p>Originally there was but one line of guards&mdash;posted some
twenty-five feet apart, upon the fence which surrounded the garrison,
and constantly walking to and fro, meeting each other and turning
back at the limits of each post. Under this arrangement it was
necessary to tunnel about forty feet to go under the fence, and come
up far enough beyond it to emerge from the earth on a dark night
without being seen or heard by the sentinels.</p>

<p>When the Commandant learned (through prisoners actually suffering
for food, and ready to do almost any thing for bread) that tunneling
was going on, he tried to ascertain where the excavations were
located; but in vain, because none of the shaky Unionists had been
informed. Therefore he established a second line of guards, one
hundred feet outside of those on the fence, who also paced back
and forth in the same manner until they met, forming a second line
impervious to Yankees. This necessitated tunneling at least one
hundred and forty feet, which, without ventilation, was just as much
out of the question as to tunnel a hundred and forty miles. </p>

<div class="sidenote">Fifteen Months of Fruitless Endeavor.</div>

<p>We were constantly trying to escape. During the last fifteen
months of our imprisonment, I think there was no day when we had not
some plan which we hoped soon to put in execution. We were always
talking and theorizing about the subject.</p>

<p>Indeed, we theorized too much. We magnified obstacles. We gave
our keepers credit for greater shrewdness and closer observation
than they were capable of. We would not start until all things
combined to promise success. Therefore, as the slow months wore away,
again and again we saw men of less capacity, but greater daring,
escape by modes which had appeared to us utterly chimerical and
impracticable.</p>

<p>Fortune, too, persistently baffled us. At the vital moment when
freedom seemed just within our grasp, some unforeseen obstacle always
intervened to foil our plans. Still, assuming a confidence we did not
feel, we daily promised each other to persist until we gained our
liberty or lost our lives. After the malignity which the Richmond
authorities had manifested toward us, escape seemed a thousand-fold
preferable to release by exchange.</p>

<p>I should hardly dare to estimate the combined length of tunnels
in which we were concerned; they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
always discovered, usually on the eve of completion. My associate was
wont to declare that we should never escape in that way, unless we
constructed an underground road to Knoxville&mdash;two hundred miles
as the bird flies!</p>

<p>Even if we passed the prison walls, the chance of reaching
our lines seemed almost hopeless. We were in the heart of the
Confederacy. During the ten months we spent in Salisbury, at least
seventy persons escaped; but nearly all were brought back, though a
few were shot in the mountains. We knew of only five who had reached
the North.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Fearful Journey in Prospect.</div>

<p>"Junius," certain to see the gloomy side of every picture,
frequently said: "To walk the same distance in Ohio or Massachusetts,
where we could travel by daylight upon public thoroughfares, stop at
each village for rest and refreshments, and sleep in warm beds every
night, we should consider a severe hardship. Think of this terrible
tramp of two hundred miles, by night, in mid-winter, over two ranges
of mountains, creeping stealthily through the enemy's country, weak,
hungry, shelterless! Can any of us live to accomplish it?"</p>

<p>When at last we did essay it, the journey proved nearly twice as
long and infinitely severer than even he had conceived.</p>

<p>Among the officers of the prison, were three stanch Union
men&mdash;a lieutenant, a surgeon, and Lieutenant John R. Welborn.
They were our devoted friends. Their homes, families, and interests,
were in the South. Attempting to escape, they were likely to be
captured and imprisoned. Remaining, they must enter the army in some
capacity, and they preferred wearing swords to carrying muskets.
Hundreds of Loyalists were in the same predicament, and adopted the
same course. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Friendly Confederate Officer.</div>

<p>These gentlemen were of service to us in a thousand ways. They
supplied us with money, books, and provisions; bore messages between
us and other friends in the village; and kept us constantly advised
of military and political events known to the officials, but
concealed from the public.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Welborn came to the garrison only about a month before
our departure. He belonged to a secret organization known as the
Sons of America, instituted expressly to assist Union men, whether
prisoners or refugees, in escaping to the North. Its members were
bound, by solemn oath, to aid brothers in distress. They recognized
each other by the signs, grips, and passwords, common to all secret
societies.</p>

<p>We soon discovered that Welborn was not only of the Order, but a
very earnest and self-sacrificing member. He was singularly daring.
At our first stolen interview he said: "You shall be out very soon,
at all hazards." Had he been detected in aiding us, it would have
cost him his life; but he was quite ready to peril it.</p>

<p>Beyond the inner line of sentinels, which was much the more
difficult one to pass, stood a Rebel hospital, where all medicines
for the garrison were stored. When we were placed in charge of the
Union hospitals, Mr. Davis was furnished with a pass to go out for
medical supplies. It was the inflexible rule of the prison that all
persons having such passes should give paroles not to escape. Davis
would have assumed no such obligation. But in the confusion incident
to the great influx of prisoners of war, and because it was the
business of several Rebel officers&mdash;the Commandant, the Medical
Director, and the Post-Adjutant&mdash;instead of the duty of one man
to see it done, he was never asked for the parole.</p>

<p>A few days later, the prison authorities gave similar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
passes to "Junius" and to Captain Thomas E. Wolfe, of Connecticut,
master of a merchant-vessel, who had been a prisoner nearly as long as
we. We attempted to convince them, through several deluded Rebel <span
lang="fr">attach&eacute;s</span>, that it was essential to the proper
conduct of the medical department that I too should be supplied with a
pass. Doubtless we should have succeeded in time, had not an incident
occurred to hasten our movements.</p>

<p>On Sunday, December 18th, we learned that General Bradley T.
Johnson, of Maryland, had arrived, and on the following day would
supersede Major Gee as Commandant of the prison. Johnson was a
soldier who knew how business should be done, and would doubtless put
a stop to this loose arrangement about passes. Not a moment was to be
lost, and we determined to escape that very night.</p>

<p>I engaged several prisoners, without informing them for what
purpose, in copying from my hospital books the names of the dead. I
felt that, to relieve friends at home, we ought to make an effort to
carry through this information, as long as there was the slightest
possibility of success.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effects of Hunger and Cold.</div>

<p>My own books only contained the names of prisoners who died in
the hospitals. "Out-door patients"&mdash;those deceased in their own
quarters, or in no quarters whatever, were recorded in a separate
book, by the Rebel clerk in the outside hospital. I dared not send to
him for their names on Sunday, lest it should excite his suspicion.
But the list from my own records was appalling. It comprised over
fourteen hundred prisoners deceased within sixty days, and showed
that they were now dying at the rate of thirteen per cent. a month on
the entire number&mdash;a rate of mortality which would depopulate
any city in the world in forty-eight hours, and send the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
people flying in all directions, as from a pestilence! Yet when
those prisoners came there, they were young and vigorous, like our
soldiers generally in the field. There was not a sick or wounded man
among them. It was a fearful revelation of the work which cold and
starvation had done.</p>

<p>When I put on extra under-clothing for the possible journey, it
was without conscious expectation&mdash;almost without any hope
whatever&mdash;of success. I had assumed the same garments for the
same purpose, at the very least, thirty times before, within fifteen
months, only to be disappointed; and that was enough to dampen the
most sanguine temperament.</p>

<p>We believed that our attempt, if detected, would be made the
excuse for treating us with peculiar rigor. But, in the event of
discovery, we were likely to be sent back to our own quarters for
the night, and not ironed or confined in a cell until the next
morning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Another Plan in Reserve.</div>

<p>Lieutenant Welborn was on duty that day. We made him privy to our
plan. He agreed, if it proved unsuccessful, to smuggle in muskets for
us; and we proposed to wrap ourselves in gray blankets, slouch our
hats down over our eyes, and pass out at midnight, as Rebel soldiers,
when he relieved the guard. Once in the camp, he could conduct us
outside.</p>

<p>On that Sunday evening, half an hour before dark (the latest
moment at which the guards could be passed, even by authorized
persons, without the countersign), Messrs. Browne, Wolfe, and Davis,
went outside, as if to order their medical supplies for the sick
prisoners. As they passed in and out a dozen times a day, and their
faces were quite familiar to the sentinels, they were not compelled
to show their passes, and "Junius" left his behind with me. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Stopped by the Sentinel.</div>

<p>A few minutes later, taking a long box filled with bottles in
which the medicines were usually brought, and giving it to a little
lad who assisted me in my hospital duties, I started to follow
them.</p>

<p>As if in great haste, we walked rapidly toward the fence, while,
leaning against trees or standing in the hospital doors, half a dozen
friends looked on to see how the plan worked. When we reached the
gate, I took the box from the boy, and said to him, of course for the
benefit of the sentinel:</p>

<p>"I am going outside to get these bottles filled. I shall be back
in about fifteen minutes, and want you to remain right here, to
take them and distribute them among the hospitals. Do not go away,
now."</p>

<p>The lad, understanding the matter perfectly, replied, "Yes, sir;"
and I attempted to pass the sentinel by mere assurance.</p>

<p>I had learned long before how far a man may go, even in captivity,
by sheer, native impudence&mdash;by moving straight on, without
hesitation, with a confident look, just as if he had a right to go,
and no one had any right to question him. Several times, as already
related, I saw captives, who had procured citizens' clothes, thus
walk past the guards in broad daylight, out of Rebel prisons.</p>

<p>I think I could have done it on this occasion, but for the
fact that it had been tried successfully twice or thrice, and the
guards severely punished. The sentinel stopped me with his musket,
demanding:</p>

<p>"Have you a pass, sir?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, I have a pass," I replied, with all the indignation
I could assume. "Have you not seen it often enough to know by this
time?"</p>

<p>Apparently a little confounded, he replied, modestly: </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">"Excuse Me for Detaining You."</div>

<p>"Probably I have; but they are very strict with us, and I was not
quite sure."</p>

<p>I gave to him this genuine pass belonging to my associate:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p class="quotdate">
      <span class="smcap">Head-quarters Confederate States Military Prison</span>, }<br />
      <span class="smcap">Salisbury</span>, N. C., <i>December 5, 1864</i>.}</p>
   <p>Junius H. Browne, Citizen, has permission to pass the inner
   gate of the Prison, to assist in carrying medicines to the
   Military Prison Hospitals, until further orders.</p>
   <p class="quotsig">J. A. Fuqua,<br />
   Captain and Assistant-Commandant of Post.</p>
</div>

<p>We had speculated for a long time about my using a spurious pass, and
my two comrades prepared several with a skill and exactness which
proved that, if their talents had been turned in that direction, they
might have made first-class forgers. But we finally decided that the
veritable pass was better, because, if the guard had any doubt about
it, I could tell him to send it into head-quarters for examination.
The answer returned would of course be that it was genuine.</p>

<p>But it was not submitted to any such inspection. The sentinel spelled
it out slowly, then folded and returned it to me, saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"That pass is all right. I know Captain Fuqua's
   handwriting. Go on, sir; excuse me for detaining you."</p>
</div>

<p>I thought him excusable under the circumstances, and walked out.
My great fear was that, during the half hour which must elapse before
I could go outside the garrison, I might encounter some Rebel officer
or <span lang="fr">attach&eacute;</span> who knew me.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Encountering Rebel Acquaintances.</div>

<p>Before I had taken ten steps, I saw, sauntering to and fro on the
piazza of the head-quarters building, a deserter from our service,
named Davidson, who recognized and bowed to me. I thought he would
not betray me, but was still fearful of it. I went on, and a few
yards farther,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
coming toward me in that narrow lane, where it was impossible to
avoid him, I saw the one Rebel officer who knew me better than any
other, and who frequently came into my quarters&mdash;Lieutenant
Stockton, the Post-Adjutant. Observing him in the distance, I thought
I recognized in him that old ill-fortune which had so long and
steadfastly baffled us. But I had the satisfaction of knowing that
my associates were on the look-out from a window and, if they saw
me involved in any trouble, would at once pass the outer gate, if
possible, and make good their own escape.</p>

<p>When we met, I bade Stockton good-evening, and talked for a few
minutes upon the weather, or some other subject in which I did not
feel any very profound interest. Then he passed into head-quarters,
and I went on. Yet a few yards farther, I encountered a third Rebel,
named Smith, who knew me well, and whose quarters, inside the
garrison, were within fifty feet of my own. There were not half a
dozen Confederates about the prison who were familiar with me; but
it seemed as if at this moment they were coming together in a grand
convention.</p>

<p>Not daring to enter the Rebel hospital, where I was certain to be
recognized, I laid down my box of medicines behind a door, and sought
shelter in a little outbuilding. While I remained there, waiting for
the blessed darkness, I constantly expected to see a sergeant, with a
file of soldiers, come to take me back into the yard; but none came.
It was rare good fortune. Stockton, Smith, and Davidson, all knew,
if they had their wits about them, that I had no more right there
than in the village itself. I suppose their thoughtlessness must have
been caused by the peculiarly honest and business-like look of that
medicine-box! </p>

<div class="sidenote">"Out of the Jaws of Death."</div>

<p>At dark, my three friends joined me. We went through the outer
gate, in full view of a sentinel, who supposed we were Rebel surgeons
or nurses. And then, on that rainy Sunday night, for the first time
in twenty months, we found ourselves walking freely in a public
street, without a Rebel bayonet before or behind us!</p>

<p>Reaching an open field, a mile from the prison, we crouched down
upon the soaked ground, in a bed of reeds, while Davis went to find
a friend who had long before promised us shelter. While lying there,
we heard a man walking through the darkness directly toward us. We
hugged the earth and held our breaths, listening to the beating of
our own hearts. He passed so near, that his coat brushed my cheek.
We were beside a path which led across the field from one house to
another. Davis soon returned, and called us with a low "Hist!" We
crept to the fence where he waited.</p>

<p>"It is all right," he said; "follow me."</p>

<p>He led us through bushes and lanes until we found our friend,
leaning against a tree in the rain, waiting for us.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" he exclaimed, "you are out at last. I wish I could
extend to you the hospitalities of my house; but it is full of
visitors, and they are all Rebels. However,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
I will take you to a tolerably safe place. I have to leave town by a
night train in half an hour, but I will tell ---- where you
are, and he will come and see you to-morrow."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hiding in Sight of the Prison.</div>

<p>He conducted us to a barn, in full sight of the prison; directed
us how to hide, wrung our hands, bade us Godspeed, and returned to
his house and his unsuspecting guests.</p>

<p>We climbed up the ladder into the hay-mow. Davis and Wolfe
burrowed down perpendicularly into the fodder, as if sinking an
oil-well, until they were covered, heads and all. "Junius" and
myself, after two hours of perspiring labor, tunneled into a safe
position under the eaves, where we lay, stretched at full length,
head to head, luxuriating in the fresh air, which came in through the
cracks.</p>

<p>Wonderfully pure and delicious it seemed, contrasted with the
foul, vitiated atmosphere we had just left! How sweet smelled the hay
and the husks! How infinite the "measureless content" which filled
us at the remembrance that at last we were free! Hearing the prison
sentinels, as they shouted "Ten o'&mdash;clock; a&mdash;ll's well!"
we sank, like Abou Ben Adhem, into a deep dream of peace.</p>

<p>Our object in remaining here was twofold. We desired to meet
Welborn, and obtain minute directions about the route, which thus far
he had found no opportunity to give us. Besides, we anticipated a
vigilant search. The Rebel authorities were thoroughly familiar with
the habits of escaping prisoners, who invariably acted as if there
were never to be any more nights after the first, and walked as far
as their strength would permit. Thus exhausted, they were unable to
resist or run, if overtaken. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Certain to be Brought Back.</div>

<p>The Commandant would be likely to send out and picket all the
probable routes near the points we could reach by a hard night's
travel. We thought it good policy to keep <em>inside</em> these scouts.
While they held the advance, they would hardly obtain tidings of us.
We could learn from the negroes where they guarded the roads and
fords, and thus easily evade them. Our shelter, in full view of the
garrison, and within sound of its morning drum-beat, was the one
place, of all others, where they would never think of searching for
us.</p>

<p>On the second morning after our disappearance, <cite>The Salisbury
Daily Watchman</cite> announced the escape, and said that it caused some
chagrin, as we were the most important prisoners in the garrison. But
it added that we were morally certain to be brought back within a
week, as scouts had been sent out in all directions, and the country
thoroughly alarmed. Some of these scouts went ninety miles from
Salisbury, but were naturally unable to learn any thing concerning
us.</p>

<p class="quotdate">II. <i>Monday, December 19.</i></p>

<p>Remained hidden in the barn. There was a house only a few yards
away, and we could hear the conversation of the inmates whenever the
doors were open. White and negro children came up into the hay-loft,
sometimes running and jumping directly over the heads of Wolfe and
Davis.</p>

<p>At dark, another friend, a commissioned officer in the Rebel
army, came out to us with a canteen of water, which, quite without
food, we had wanted sadly during the day. He was unable to bring us
provisions. His wife was a Southern lady. Reluctant to cause her
anxiety for his liberty and property, imperiled by aiding us, or from
some other reason, he did not take her into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
the secret. Like most frugal wives, where young and adult negroes
abound, she kept her provisions under lock and key, and he found it
impossible to procure even a loaf of bread without her knowledge.</p>

<p>With his parting benediction, we returned to the field where we
had waited the night before, and found Lieutenant Welborn, punctual
to appointment, with another escaped prisoner, Charles Thurston, of
the Sixth New Hampshire Infantry.</p>

<p>Thurston had two valuable possessions&mdash;great address, and the
uniform of a Confederate private. At ten o'clock, on Sunday night,
learning of our escape, and thinking us a good party to accompany,
he walked out of the prison yard behind two Rebel detectives, the
sentinel taking him for a third officer. Slouching his hat over his
face, with matchless effrontery he sat down on a log, among the Rebel
guards. In a few minutes he caught the eye of Welborn, who soon led
him by all the sentinels, giving the countersign as he passed, until
he was outside the garrison, and then hid him in a barn, half a mile
from our place of shelter. The negroes fed him during the day; and
now here he was, jovial, sanguine, daring, ready to start for the
North Pole itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Commencing the Long Journey.</div>

<p>Welborn gave us written directions how to reach friends in a
stanch Union settlement fifty miles away. It was hard to part from
the noble fellow. At that very moment he was under arrest, and
awaiting trial by court martial, on the charge of aiding prisoners to
escape. In due time he was acquitted. Three months later he reached
our lines at Knoxville, with thirty Union prisoners, whom he had
conducted from Salisbury.</p>

<p>We said adieu, and went out into the starry silence. Plowing
through the mud for three miles, we struck the Western Railroad, and
followed it. Beside it were several

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
camps with great fires blazing in front of them. Uncertain whether
they were occupied by guards or wood-choppers, we kept on the safe
side, and flanked them by wide <span lang="fr">d&eacute;tours</span>
through the almost impenetrable forest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Too Weak for Traveling.</div>

<p>We were very weak. In the garrison we had been burying from twelve
to twenty men per day, from pneumonia. I had suffered from it for
more than a month, and my cough was peculiarly hollow and stubborn.
My lungs were still sore and sensitive, and walking greatly exhausted
me. It was difficult, even when supported by the arm of one of my
friends, to keep up with the party. At midnight I was compelled to
lie, half unconscious, upon the ground, for three-quarters of an
hour, before I could go on.</p>

<p>We accomplished twelve miles during the night. At three o'clock in
the morning we went into the pine-woods, and rested upon the frozen
ground.</p>

<p class="quotdate">III. <i>Tuesday, December 20.</i></p>

<p>We supposed our hiding-place very secluded; but daylight revealed
that it was in the midst of a settlement. Barking dogs, crowing
fowls, and shouting negroes, could be heard from the farms all about
us. It was very cold, and we dared not build a fire. None of us were
adequately clothed, and "Junius" had not even an overcoat. It was
impossible to bring extra garments, which would have excited the
attention of the sentinel at the gate.</p>

<p>We could sleep for a few minutes on the pine-leaves; but soon
the chilly air, penetrating every fibre, would awaken us. There was
a road, only a few yards from our pine-thicket, upon which we saw
horsemen and farmers with loads of wood, but no negroes unaccompanied
by white men. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Severe March in the Rain.</div>

<p>Soon after dark it began to rain; but necessity, that inexorable
policeman, bade us move on. When we approached a large plantation,
leaving us behind, in a fence-corner, Thurston went forward to
reconnoiter. He found the negro quarters occupied by a middle-aged
man and woman. They were very busy that night, cooking for and
serving the young white people, who had a pleasure-party at the
master's house, within a stone's throw of the slave-cabin.</p>

<p>But when they learned that there were hungry Yankees in the
neighborhood, they immediately prepared and brought out to us an
enormous supper of fresh pork and corn-bread. It was now nine o'clock
on Tuesday night, and we had eaten nothing since three o'clock Sunday
afternoon, save about three ounces of bread and four ounces of meat
to the man. We had that to think of which made us forget the gnawings
of hunger, though we suffered somewhat from a feeling of faintness.
Now, in the barn, with the rain pattering on the roof, we devoured
supper in an incredibly brief period, and begged the slave to go back
with his basket and bring just as much more.</p>

<p>About midnight the negro found time to pilot us through the dense
darkness and pouring rain, back to the railroad, from which we had
strayed three miles. The night was bitterly cold, and in half an hour
we were as wet as if again shipwrecked in the Mississippi.</p>

<p>For five weary miles we plodded on, with the stinging rain pelting
our faces. Then we stopped at a plantation, and found the negroes.
They told us it was unsafe to remain, several white men being at
home, and no good hiding-place near, but directed us to a neighbor's.
There the slaves sent us to a roadside barn, which we reached just
before daylight. </p>

<p>The barn contained no fodder except damp husks. Burrowing into
these, we wrapped our dripping coats about us, covered ourselves,
faces and all, and shivered through the day, so weary that we drowsed
a little, but too uncomfortable for any refreshing slumbers.</p>

<p>Rising at dark, with skins irritated by atoms of husk which
had penetrated our clothing, we combed out our matted hair and
beards&mdash;a very faint essay toward making our toilets. Hats,
gloves, handkerchiefs, and haversacks, were hopelessly lost in the
fodder. Hungry, cold, rheumatic, aching at every joint, we seemed to
have exhausted our slender endurance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Cabin of Friendly Negroes.</div>

<p>But a walk of ten minutes took us to a slave-cabin, where, as
usual, we found devoted friends. The old negro killed two chickens,
and then stood outside, to watch and warn us of the patrols, should
he hear the clattering hoofs of their approaching horses. His wife
and daughter cooked supper, while we stood before the blazing logs of
the wide-mouthed fireplace, to dry our steaming garments.</p>

<p>It was the first dwelling I had entered for nearly twenty months.
It was rude almost to squalor; but it looked more palatial than the
most elegant and luxurious saloon. There was a soft bed, with clean,
snowy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
sheets. How I envied those negroes, and longed to stretch my limbs
upon it and sleep for a month! There were chairs, a table, plates,
knives, and forks&mdash;the commonest comforts of life, which, like
sweet cold water, clean clothing, and pure air, we never appreciate
until once deprived of them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Southerners Unacquainted with Tea.</div>

<p>We eagerly devoured the chickens and hot corn-bread, and drank
steaming cups of green tea, which our ebony hostess, unfamiliar
with the beverage that cheers, but not inebriates, prepared under
my directions. Before starting I had taken the precaution to fill a
pocket with tea, which I had been saving more than a year for that
purpose. In commercial parlance, tea was tea in the Confederacy.
The last pound we purchased, for daily use, cost us one hundred and
twenty-seven dollars in Rebel currency, and we were compelled to send
to Wilmington before we could obtain it even at that price.</p>

<p>It is an article little used by the Southerners, who are
inveterate coffee-drinkers. All along our route we found the
women, white and black, ignorant of the art of making tea without
instructions. Captain Wolfe assured us that his father once attended
a log-rolling in South Carolina, where, as a rare and costly luxury,
the host regaled the workers with tea at the close of their labors.
But, unacquainted with its use, they were only presented with the
boiled leaves to eat! After this novel banquet, one old lady thus
expressed the views of the rural assembly: "Well, I never tasted this
before. It is pleasant enough; but except for the name of it, I don't
consider tea a bit better than any other kind of greens!"</p>

<p>Experience on the great Plains and among the Rocky Mountains had
taught me the superiority of tea over all stronger stimulants in
severe, protracted hardships.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
Now it proved of inestimable service to us. After a two-hours' halt,
refreshed by food and dry clothing, we seemed to have a new lease of
life. Elastic and vigorous, we felt equal to almost any labor.</p>

<p>"May God bless you," said the old woman, bidding us adieu, while
earnest sympathy shone from her own and her daughter's eyes and
illumined their dark faces. To us they were "black, and comely too."
The husband led us to the railroad, and there parted from us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Walking Twelve Miles for Nothing.</div>

<p>At midnight we were twenty-three miles from Salisbury, and three
from Statesville. We wished to avoid the latter village; and leaving
the railway, which ran due west, turned farther northward. In two
miles we expected to strike the Wilkesboro road, at Allison's Mill.
We followed the old negro's directions as well as possible, but soon
suspected that we must be off the route. It was bitterly cold, and
to avoid suffering we walked on and on with great rapidity. Before
daylight, at a large plantation, we wakened a slave, and learned
that, since leaving the railway, we had traveled twelve miles
circuitously and gained just one half-mile on the journey! There were
two Allison's Mills, and our black friend had directed us to the
wrong one.</p>

<p>"Can you conceal us here to-day?" we asked in a whisper of
the negro who gave us this information from his bed, in a little
cabin.</p>

<p>"I reckon so. Master is a terrible war-man, a Confederate officer,
and would kill me if he were to find it out. But I kept a sick Yankee
captain here last summer for five days, and then he went on. Go to
the barn and hide, and I will see you when I come to fodder the
horses."</p>

<p>We found the barn, groped our way up into a hay-loft, under the
eaves, and buried ourselves in the straw. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Every Black Face a Friendly Face.</div>

<p class="quotdate">V. <i>Thursday, December 22.</i></p>

<p>The biting wind whistled and shrieked between the logs of the
barn, and, cover ourselves as we would, it was too cold for sleep.
The negro&mdash;an intelligent young man&mdash;spent several hours
with us, asking questions about the North, brought us ample supplies
of food, and a bottle of apple-brandy purloined from his master's
private stores.</p>

<p>At dark he took us into his quarters, only separated by a narrow
lane from the planter's house, and we were warmed and fed. A dozen of
the blacks&mdash;including little boys and girls of ten and twelve
years&mdash;visited us there. Among them was a peculiarly intelligent
mulatto woman of twenty-five, comely, and neatly dressed. The poor
girl interrogated us for an hour very earnestly about the progress
of the War, its probable results, and the feeling and purposes of
the North touching the slaves. Using language with rare propriety,
she impressed me as one who would willingly give up life for her
unfortunate race. With culture and opportunity, she would have been
an intellectual and social power in any circle. She was the wife of
a slave; but her companions told us that she had been compelled to
become the mistress of her master. She spoke of him with intense
loathing.</p>

<p>By this time we had learned that every black face was a friendly
face. So far as fidelity was concerned, we felt just as safe among
the negroes as if in our Northern homes. Male or female, old or
young, intelligent or simple, we were fully assured they would never
betray us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Touching Fidelity of the Slaves.</div>

<p>Some one has said that it needs three generations to make a
gentleman. Heaven only knows how many generations are required to
make a freeman! But we have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
been accustomed to consider this perfect trustworthiness, this
complete loyalty to friends, a distinctively Saxon trait. The very
rare degree to which the negroes have manifested it, is an augury
of brightest hope and promise for their future. It is a faint
indication of what they may one day become, with Justice, Time, and
Opportunity.</p>

<p>They were always ready to help anybody opposed to the Rebels.
Union refugees, Confederate deserters, escaped prisoners&mdash;all
received from them the same prompt and invariable kindness. But let a
Rebel soldier, on his way to the army, or returning from it, apply to
them, and he would find but cold kindness.</p>

<p>The moment they met us, they would do whatever we required upon
impulse and instinct. But afterward, when there was leisure for
conversation, they would question us with some anxiety. Few had ever
seen a Yankee before. They would repeat to us the bugbear stories of
their masters, about our whipping them to force them into the Union
army, and starving their wives and children. Professing utterly to
discredit these reports, they still desired a little reassurance.
We can never forget their upturned, eager eyes, and earnest faces.
Happily we could tell them that the Nation was rising to the great
principles of Freedom, Education, and an open Career for every human
being.</p>

<p>Starting at ten o'clock to-night, we had an arduous march over the
rough, frozen ground. Hard labor and loss of sleep began to tell upon
us. I think every member of the party had his mental balance more or
less shaken. Davis was haggard, with blood-shot eyes; "Junius" was
pallid, and threatened with typhoid fever; Wolfe, with a sprained
ankle, could barely limp; I was weak and short of breath, from the
pneumonic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
affection. Charley Thurston was our best foot, and we always put him
foremost. With his Confederate uniform and his ready invention, he
could play Rebel soldier admirably.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pursued by a Home Guard.</div>

<p>Toward morning we were compelled to stop, build a fire in the
dense pine-forest, and rest for an hour. We were uncertain about the
roads, and just before daylight Charley stopped to make inquiries of
an old farmer. Then we went on, and, as the road was very secluded,
were talking with less discretion than usual, when a twig snapped
behind us. Instantly turning around, we saw the old man following
stealthily, listening to our conversation. We ordered him to halt;
but he ran away with wonderful agility for a septuagenarian.</p>

<p>The moment he was out of sight, we left the road, and ran, too,
in an opposite direction, fast as our tired limbs could carry us.
It would be a very nice point to determine which was the more
frightened, we or our late pursuer. We afterward learned that he
was an unrelenting Rebel and a zealous Home Guard. He was doubtless
endeavoring to follow us to our shelter, that he might bring out his
company, and capture us during the day.</p>

<p>Long after daylight we continued running, until we had put five
miles between ourselves and the road. The region was very open, and
it seemed morally certain that we would be discovered through the
barking dogs at some of the farm-houses. But about nine o'clock we
halted in a pine-grove, small but thick, and built a great fire of
rails, which, being very dry, emitted little smoke. There was danger
that the blaze would be discovered; but in our feeble condition we
could no longer endure the inclemency of the weather. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span></p>

<p class="quotdate">VI. <i>Friday, December 23.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Help in the Last Extremity.</div>

<p>Hungry and fatigued, with our feet to the fire, we could sleep
an hour at a time upon the frozen ground before the cold awakened
us. When, after a waiting which seemed endless, the welcome darkness
came at last, it lifted a load from our hearts; we no longer listened
anxiously for the coming of the Guard.</p>

<p>Starting again, we toiled on with slow and painful steps. We
were entering a region where slaves were few, and we could find no
negroes. "Junius," in a high fever, was so weak that we were almost
compelled to carry him, and his voice was faint as the wail of an
infant. Again and again he begged us to go on, and leave him to rest
upon the ground. We had sore apprehensions that it might become
necessary to commit him to the first friends we found, and press
forward without him.</p>

<p>About eight o'clock Charley entered a little tavern to procure
provisions. He assumed his favorite character of a Rebel soldier,
on parole, going to his home in Wilkes County for the holidays. An
old man was spending the night there. While supper was cooking, he
gave to Charley a recognizing sign of the Sons of America. It was
instantly answered; and, stepping outside, they had an interview.</p>

<p>Then our new friend stealthily led his three mules from the
tavern stable, through the fields to the road, placed three of us
upon them, and guided us five miles, to the house of his brother,
another strong Union man. The brother warmed us, fed us, and "stayed
us with flagons" of apple-brandy; then brought out two of his mules,
and again we pressed forward. They cautioned us not to intrust the
secret of their assistance to any one, reminding us that it would be
a hanging matter for them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Carried Fifteen Miles by Friends.</div>

<p>So, on this cold winter night, while we were so stiff
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
and exhausted that we could barely keep our seats on the steeds
they had so thoughtfully furnished, these kind friends conducted us
fifteen miles, and left us in the Union settlement we were seeking,
fifty miles from Salisbury. </p>

<div class="sidenote">Curious Confusion of Names.</div>

<p>It was now five o'clock in the morning of Saturday, December 24th,
the seventh day of our escape. Leaving my companions behind, I tapped
at the door of a log-house.</p>

<p>"Come in," said a voice; and I entered. In its one room the
children and father were still in bed; the wife was already engaged
in her daily duties. I asked:</p>

<p>"Can you direct me to the widow ----?"</p>

<p>"There are two widow ----s, in this neighborhood," she replied.
"What is your name?"</p>

<p>I was seeking information, just then, not giving it; so avoiding
the question, I added:</p>

<p>"The lady I mean, has a son who is an officer in the army."</p>

<p>"They both have sons who are officers in the army. Don't be
afraid; you are among friends."</p>

<p>"Friends" might mean Union or it might mean Rebel; so I accepted
no amendments, but adhered to the main question:</p>

<p>"This officer is a lieutenant, and his name is John."</p>

<p>"Well," said she, "they are both lieutenants, and John is the name
of both!"</p>

<p>I knew my man too well to be baffled. I continued:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
"He is in the second regiment of the Senior Reserves; and is now on
duty at ----."</p>

<p>"Oh," said she, "that is my brother!"</p>

<p>At once I told her what we were. She replied, with a wonderful
light of welcome shining in her eyes:</p>

<p>"If you are Yankees, all I have to say is, that you have come to
exactly the right place!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Food, Shelter, and Hosts of Friends.</div>

<p>And, in exuberant joy, she bustled about, doing a dozen things
at once, talking incoherently the while, replenishing the fire,
bringing me a seat, offering me food, urging her husband to hurry out
for the rest of the party. At last her excitement culminated in her
darting under the bed, and reappearing on the surface with a great
pint tumbler filled to the brim with apple-brandy. There was enough
to intoxicate our whole party! It was the first form of hospitality
which occurred to her. Afterward, when better acquainted, she
explained:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"You were the first Yankee I ever saw. The moment I
   observed your clothing, I knew you must be one, and I
   wanted to throw my arms about your neck, and kiss you!"</p>
</div>

<p>We heartily reciprocated the feeling. Just then the only woman who
had any charms for us was the Goddess of Liberty; and this, at least,
was one of her handmaidens.</p>

<p>We were soon by the great log fire of a house where friends
awaited us. Belonging to the secret Union organization, they had
received intelligence that we were on the way. Our feet were
blistered and swollen; mine were frostbitten. We removed our
clothing, and were soon reposing in soft feather beds. At noon,
awakened for breakfast, we found "Junius" had been sleeping like a
child, and was now hungry&mdash;a relief to our anxiety. After the
meal was over, we returned to bed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Loyalty of the Mountaineers.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span></p>

<p>Our friends were constantly on the alert; but the house was very
secluded, and they were not compelled to watch outside. There,
two ferocious dogs were on guard, rendering it unsafe for any one
to come within a hundred yards of them. Nearly all the people,
Loyal and Rebel, had similar sentinels. Along the route, we had
been anathematizing the canine race, which often prevented us from
approaching negro-quarters on the plantations; but these were Union
dogs, which made all the difference in the world.</p>

<p>At dark, we were conducted to a barn, where, wrapped in quilts, we
passed a comfortable night.</p>

<p class="quotdate">VIII. <i>Sunday, December 25.</i></p>

<p>Our resting-place was in Wilkes County, North Carolina, among the
outlying spurs of the Alleghanies&mdash;a county so strong in its
Union sentiments, that the Rebels called it "the Old United States."
Among the mountains of every Southern State, a vast majority of
the people were loyal. Hilly regions, unadapted to cotton-culture,
contained few negroes; and where there was no Slavery, there was no
Rebellion. Milton's verse&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
   <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i0">"The <em>mountain</em> nymph, sweet Liberty,"</span>
   </div>
</div>

<p>contains a great truth, the world over.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Levee in a Barn.</div>

<p>Our self-sacrificing friends belonged to a multitudinous family,
extending through a settlement many miles in length. They all
seemed to be nephews, cousins, or brothers; and the white-haired
patriarch&mdash;at seventy, erect and agile as a boy,&mdash;in whose
barn we remained to-day, was father, grandfather, or uncle, to the
whole tribe. His loyalty was very stanch and intense.</p>

<p>"The Home Guards," said he, "are usually pretty civil.
Occasionally they shoot at some of the boys who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
are hiding; but pretty soon afterward, one of them is found in the
woods some morning with a hole in his head! I suppose there are a
thousand young men lying out in this county. I have always urged them
to fight the Guards, and have helped to supply them with ammunition.
Two or three times, regiments from Lee's army have been sent here
to hunt conscripts and deserters, and then the boys have to run. I
have a son among them; but they never wounded him yet. I asked him
the other day: 'Won't you kill some of them before you are ever
captured?' 'Well, father,' says he, '<em>I'll be found a tryin'!</em>' I
reckon he will, too; for he has never gone without his rifle these
two years, and he can bring down a squirrel every time, from the top
of yon oak you see on the hill."</p>

<p>The barn was beside a public road, and very near the house of
a woman whose Rebel sympathies were strong. There was danger that
any one entering it might be seen by her or her children, who were
running about the yard.</p>

<p>But we held quite a <span lang="fr">lev&eacute;e</span> to-day.
I think we had fifty visitors. We would hear the opening door and
stealthy footsteps upon the barn-floor; then a soft voice would
ask:</p>

<p>"Friends, are you there?"</p>

<p>We would rise from our bed of hay, and come forward to the front
of the loft, to find some member of this great family of friends,
who had brought his wife and children to see the Yankees. We would
converse with them for a few minutes; they would invariably ask if
there was nothing whatever they could do for us, invite us to visit
their house by night, and express the warmest wishes for our success.
They did this with such perfect spontaneity, with such overflowing
hearts, that it touched us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
very nearly. Had we been their own sons or brothers, they could not
have treated us more tenderly. This Christmas may have witnessed more
brilliant gatherings than ours; but none, I am sure, warmed by a more
self-sacrificing friendship.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Visited by an Old Friend.</div>

<p>Among others, we were visited by a conscript, who had been one
of our guards at Salisbury. While at the prison, his great portly
form would come laboring and puffing up the stairs to our quarters;
with flushed face, he would sit down, glance cautiously around to
assure himself that none but friends were present, then question us
eagerly about the North, and breathe out maledictions against all
Confederates.</p>

<p>The Rebels, suspecting him, determined to send him to Lee's army.
But he was just then taken with rheumatism, and kept his quarters for
six weeks! At last, the day before he was to start for Richmond, he
obtained permission of the surgeon to visit the village. He hobbled
up the street, groaning piteously; but, after turning the first
corner, threw away his crutches, plunged into the woods, and made
his way home by night. He now related his experiences with a quiet
chuckle, and was very desirous of serving us.</p>

<p>He was able to give me a pair of large boots in place of my own,
which lacerated my sore and swollen feet. The sharp rocks, hills,
and stumps, compelled me to have the new boots repaired seven times
before reaching our lines. Two nights' traveling would quite wear out
the ill-tanned leather of the stoutest soles.</p>

<p>To-day, our friends brought us twice as much food as we wanted,
and we wanted a great deal. At dark, alarmed by a rumor that the
suspicions of the Guard had been excited, they took us several miles
into a neighboring county, to a very secluded house, occupied by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
wife and daughters of an officer in the Confederate army. Here we
spent the night in inviting beds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Day of Alarms.</div>

<p class="quotdate">IX. <i>Monday, December 26.</i></p>

<p>Our hostess, a comely lady of thirty-five, was a second Mrs.
Katie Scudder&mdash;the very embodiment of "Faculty." Her plain log
house, with its snowy curtains, cheap prints, and engravings cut
from illustrated newspapers, was tasteful and inviting. Her five
daughters, all clothed in fabric spun and woven at home&mdash;for
these people were now entirely self-dependent&mdash;looked as pretty
and tidy to uncritical, masculine eyes, as if robed in silk and
cashmere.</p>

<p>Our pursuit of a quiet refuge proved ludicrously unsuccessful. The
day was diversified by</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>"More pangs and fears than wars or women have."</p>
</div>

<p>But the lady bore herself with such coolness, and proved so ready
for every emergency, that we enjoyed them rather than otherwise.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, while standing a few yards from the house, I
saw her and her daughter suddenly step into the open doorway, quite
filling it with their persons and skirts, and earnestly beckon me
to go in out of sight. Of course, I obeyed. A woman of questionable
political soundness had called; but they attracted her in another
direction, keeping her face turned away from the door, till I was
lost to sight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ready Wit of a Woman.</div>

<p>Several parties of Rebel cavalry passed down the road.
Breckinridge's army, in the mountains above, had recently dissolved
in a great thaw and break-up, and these were the small fragments of
ice floating down toward Virginia. A squad of a dozen stopped and
entered the house, which was of one story, the length of three large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
rooms. But the lady kept them in the kitchen, while we were shut in
the other end of the building.</p>

<p>Next, the barking dog warned us of approaching footsteps. At her
suggestion, we went up into the corn-loft, above our apartment. The
new visitor was a neighbor, to whom she owed a bushel of corn, and
who, with his ox-cart, had come to collect it. With ready woman's
wit, she said to him:</p>

<p>"You know my husband is away. I have no fuel. Won't you go and
haul me a load of wood, as a Christmas present?"</p>

<p>Who could resist such a feminine appeal? The neighbor went for
the wood, while she came laughing in, to tell us her stratagem.
We descended from the corn-loft, and went into a back room, where
there were two beds, one large and the other small, with an open
door between them. Four of us crept under the large bed, one under
the small one; and here we had an experience, ludicrous enough to
remember, but not so pleasant to undergo.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Danger of Detection from Snoring.</div>

<p>One of our party was an inveterate snorer. Whenever he took a
recumbent position, with his head upon the ground or the floor, he
would begin snoring like a steam-engine. Like all persons of that
class, when reminded of it, he steadfastly vowed that he never snored
in all his life! For a time, he regarded our awakening him, with
rebuke and caution, as a sorry practical joke.</p>

<p>Thus far, I believe our danger of detection had been greater from
this source than from any other. We had always traveled in single
file, almost like specters, with our leader thrown out as far ahead
as we could keep him in view. Whenever he thought he saw danger, he
raised a warning hand; every man passed the sign back to those in his
rear, and dropped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
quietly behind a log, or stepped into the bushes, until the person
had passed or the alarm was explained. We walked with softest
footsteps, no man coughing, or speaking above his breath. During the
day we were often concealed in very public places, only a few feet
from the road, where, the ground being covered with snow, we could
not hear approaching footsteps.</p>

<p>Now, our musical companion chanced to go under the small bed, and
in three minutes we heard his trumpet-tongued snore. At first, we
whispered to him; but we might as well have talked to Niagara. If one
of us went to him, there was danger that the neighbor, who stood upon
the front porch, would see us through the open door; but if we did
not, that fatal snore was certain to be heard. So I darted across the
room, crept in beside my friend, and kept him well shaken until the
danger was over.</p>

<p>At night, the lady told us that more people had come to her
house during the day than ever visited it in a month before; and
we were marched back through the darkness, to our first place of
concealment.</p>

<p class="quotdate">X. <i>Tuesday, December 27.</i></p>

<p>In the barn through the whole day. A messenger brought us a
note from two late fellow-prisoners, Captain William Boothby, a
Philadelphia mariner, and Mr. John Mercer, a Unionist, of Newbern,
North Carolina, who had been in duress almost three years. They were
now hiding in a barn two miles from us. They escaped from Salisbury
two nights later than we, paying the guards eight hundred dollars in
Confederate money to let them out.</p>

<p>Thurston at once joined them. During the rest of the journey, we
sometimes traveled and hid together for several days and nights;
but, when there was special danger, divided into two companies, one
keeping twenty-four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
hours in advance&mdash;the smaller the party, the less peril being
involved.</p>

<p>Now, for the first time, we began to have some hope of reaching
our lines. But the road was still very long, and fraught with many
dangers. We examined the appalling list of dead, which I had brought
from Salisbury, and talked much of our companions left behind in that
living entombment. Remembering how earnestly they longed and prayed
for some intelligent, trustworthy voice to bear to the Government
and the people tidings of their terrible condition, we pledged each
other very solemnly, that if any one of us lived to regain home
and freedom, he should use earnest, unremitting efforts to excite
sympathy and secure relief for them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Promises to aid Suffering Comrades.</div>

<p>It may not be out of place here to say, that upon reaching
the North, before visiting our families, or performing any other
duties, we hastened to Washington, and used every endeavor to call
the attention of the authorities and the country to the Salisbury
prisoners. Before many weeks, all who survived were exchanged; but
more than five thousand&mdash;upwards of half the number who were
taken to Salisbury five months before&mdash;were already buried just
outside the garrison.</p>

<p>Those five thousand loyal graves will ever remain fitting
monuments of Rebel cruelty, and of the atrocious inhumanity of Edwin
M. Stanton, Secretary of War, who steadfastly refused to exchange
these prisoners, on the ground that we could not afford to give
the enemy robust, vigorous men for invalids and skeletons, and yet
refrained from compelling them to treat prisoners with humanity, by
just and discriminating retaliation upon an equal number of Rebel
officers, taken from the great excess held by our Government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Blind and Unquestioning Loyalty.</div>

<p>To-day, as usual, we saw a large number of the Union
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
mountaineers. Theirs was a very blind and unreasoning loyalty, much
like the disloyalty of some enthusiastic Rebels. They did not say
"Unionist," or "Secessionist," but always designated a political
friend thus: "He is one of the right sort of people"&mdash;strong in
the faith that there could, by no possibility, be more than one side
to the question. They had little education; but when they began to
talk about the Union, their eyes lighted wonderfully, and sometimes
they grew really eloquent. They did not believe one word in a Rebel
newspaper, except extracts from the Northern journals, and reports
favorable to our Cause. They thought the Union army had never been
defeated in a single battle. I heard them say repeatedly:</p>

<p>"The United States can take Richmond any day when it wants to.
That it has not, thus far, is owing to no lack of power, but because
it was not thought best."</p>

<p>They regarded every Rebel as necessarily an unmitigated scoundrel,
and every Loyalist, particularly every native-born Yankee, almost as
an angel from heaven.</p>

<p>How earnestly they questioned us about the North! How they longed
to escape thither! To them, indeed, it was the Promised Land. They
were very bitter in their denunciations of the heavy slaveholders,
who had done so much to degrade white labor, and finally brought on
this terrible war.</p>

<p>They had an abundance of the two great Southern
staples&mdash;corn-bread and pork. They felt severely the absence of
their favorite beverage, and would ask us, with amusing earnestness,
if they could get coffee when our armies came. The Confederate
substitutes&mdash;burnt corn and rye&mdash;they regarded with earnest
and well-founded aversion.</p>

<p>They were compelled to use thorns for fastening the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
clothing of the women and children. We distributed among them our
small supply of pins, to their infinite delectation. Davis also
gladdened the hearts of all the womankind by disbursing a needle to
each. A needle nominally represented five dollars in Confederate
currency, but actually could not be purchased at any price.</p>

<p>A number of the young men "lying out" desired to accompany us to
the North. Some were deserters from the Rebel army; others, more
fortunate, had evaded conscription from the beginning of the war.
But their lives had been passed in that remote county of North
Carolina, and the two hundred and ninety miles yet to be accomplished
stretched out in appalling prospective. They saw many lions in the
way, and, Festus-like, at the last moment, decided to wait for a more
convenient season. It was not from lack of nerve; for some of them
had fought Rebel guards with great coolness and bravery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Repentant Rebel.</div>

<p>Our friends feared that one slaveholding Secessionist in the
neighborhood might learn of our presence, and betray us. He did
ascertain our whereabouts, but sent us an invitation to visit his
house, offering to supply all needed food, clothing, and shelter. He
said he foolishly acquiesced in the Revolution because at first it
seemed certain to succeed, and he wished to save his property; but
that now he heartily repented.</p>

<p>Possibly his conversion was partially owing to remorse for having
persuaded his two sons to enter the Rebel army. One, after much
suffering, had deserted, and was now "lying out" near home. The
other, wounded and captured in a "Virginia battle, was still in a
Northern prison, where he had been confined for many months. The
father was very desirous of sending to him a message of sympathy and
affection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sanguine Hopes of Loyal Mountaineers.</div>

<p>But he was an index of the change which had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
recently come over Rebel sympathizers in that whole region. The
condition of our armies then was not peculiarly promising. We were by
no means sanguine that the war would soon terminate. But the loyal
mountaineers, with unerring instinct, were all confident that we
were near its close, and constantly surprised us by speaking of the
Rebellion as a thing of the past. We fancied their wish was father to
the thought; but they proved truer prophets than we. </p>

   </div>
</div>

<p>On the evening of the eleventh day, Wednesday, December 28, we
left the kind friends with whom we had stayed for five days and
four nights, gaining new vigor and inspired by new hope. Their last
injunction was:</p>

<p>"Remember, you cannot be too careful. We shall pray God that you
may reach your homes in safety. When you are there, do not forget
us, but do send troops to open a way by which we can escape to the
North."</p>

<p>In their simplicity, they fancied Yankees omnipotent, and that we
could send them an army by merely saying the word. They bade us adieu
with embraces and tears. I am sure many a fervent prayer went up from
their humble hearths, that Our Father would guide us through the
difficulties of our long, wearisome journey, and guard us against the
perils which beset and environed it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Flanking a Rebel Camp.</div>

<p>At ten o'clock we passed within two hundred yards of a Rebel camp.
We could hear the neigh of the horses and the tramp of four or five
sentinels on their rounds. We trod very softly; to our stimulated
senses every sound was magnified, and every cracking twig startled
us.</p>

<p>Leaving us in the road a few yards behind, our pilot entered the
house of his friend, a young deserter from the Rebel army. Finding no
one there but the family, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
called us in, to rest by the log fire, while the deserter rose from
bed, and donned his clothing to lead us three miles and point out a
secluded path. For many months he had been "lying out;" but of late,
as the Guards were less vigilant than usual, he sometimes ventured to
sleep at home. His girlish wife wished him to accompany us through;
but, with the infant sleeping in the cradle, which was hewn out of a
great log, she formed a tie too strong for him to break. At parting,
she shook each of us by the hand, saying:</p>

<p>"I hope you will get safely home; but there is great danger, and
you must be powerful cautious."</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock our guide left us in the hands of a negro, who,
after our chilled limbs were warmed, led us on our way. By two in the
morning we had accomplished thirteen miles over the frozen hills, and
reached a lonely house in a deep valley, beside a tumbling, flashing
torrent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Secreted among the Husks.</div>

<p>The farmer, roused with difficulty from his heavy slumbers,
informed us that Boothby's party, which had arrived twenty-four hours
in advance of us, was sleeping in his barn. He sent us half a mile
to the house of a neighbor, who fanned the dying embers on his great
hearth, regaled us with the usual food, and then took us to a barn in
the forest.</p>

<p>"Climb up on that scaffolding," said he. "Among the husks you will
find two or three quilts. They belong to my son, who is lying out.
To-night he is sleeping with some friends in the woods."</p>

<p>The cold wind blew searchingly through the open barn, but before
daylight we were wrapped in "the mantle that covers all human
thoughts." </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span></p>

<p class="quotdate">XII. <i>Thursday, December 29.</i></p>

<p>At dark, our host, leaving us in a thicket, five hundred yards
from his house, went forward to reconnoiter. Finding the coast clear,
he beckoned us on to supper and ample potations of apple-brandy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"> Wandering from the Road.</div>

<p>With difficulty we induced one of his neighbors to guide us.
Though unfamiliar with the road, he was an excellent walker, swiftly
leading us over the rough ground, which tortured our sensitive feet,
and up and down sharp, rocky hills.</p>

<p>At two in the morning we flanked Wilkesboro, the capital of Wilkes
County. To a chorus of barking dogs, we crept softly around it,
within a few hundred yards of the houses. The air was full of snow,
and when we reached the hills again, the biting wind was hard to
breathe.</p>

<p>We walked about a mile through the dense woods, when Captain
Wolfe, who had been all the time declaring that the North Star was on
the wrong side of us, convinced our pilot that he had mistaken the
road, and we retraced our steps to the right thoroughfare.</p>

<p>We stopped to warm for half an hour at a negro-cabin, where the
blacks told us all they knew about the routes and the Rebels. Before
morning we were greatly broken down, and our guide was again in doubt
concerning the roads. So we entered a deep ravine in the pine-woods,
built a great fire, and waited for daylight.</p>

<p class="quotdate">XIII. <i>Friday, December 30.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Crossing the Yadkin River.</div>

<p>After dawn, we pressed forward, reluctantly compelled to pass near
two or three houses.</p>

<p>We reached the Yadkin River just as a young, blooming woman, with
a face like a ripe apple, came gliding across the stream. With a long
pole, she guided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
the great log canoe, which contained herself, a pail of butter, and
a side-saddle, indicating that she had started for the Wilkesboro
market. Assisting her to the shore, we asked:</p>

<p>"Will you tell us where Ben Hanby lives?"</p>

<p>"Just beyond the hill there, across the river," she replied, with
scrutinizing, suspicious eyes.</p>

<p>"How far is it to his house?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"More than a mile?"</p>

<p>"No" (doubtfully), "I reckon not."</p>

<p>"Is he probably at home?"</p>

<p>"No!" (emphatically). "He is <em>not</em>! Are you the Home Guard?"</p>

<p>"By no means, madam. We are Union men, and Yankees at that. We
have escaped from Salisbury, and are trying to reach our homes in the
North."</p>

<p>After another searching glance, she trusted us fully, and said:</p>

<p>"Ben Hanby is my husband. He is lying out. I wondered, if you were
the Guard, what you could be doing without guns. From a hill near
our house, the children saw you coming more than an hour ago; and my
husband, taking you for the soldiers, went with his rifle to join his
companions in the woods. Word has gone to every Union house in the
neighborhood that the troops are out hunting deserters."</p>

<p>We embarked in the log canoe, and shipped a good deal of water
before reaching the opposite shore. We had two sea-captains on board,
and concluded that, with one sailor more, we should certainly have
been hopelessly wrecked.</p>

<p>A winding forest-path led to the lonely house we sought, where we
found no one at home, except three children
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
of our fair informant and their grandmother. For more than two hours
we could not allay the woman's suspicions that we were Guards. They
had recently been adopting Yankee disguises, deceiving Union people,
and beguiling them of damaging information.</p>

<p>As indignantly as General Damas inquires whether he <em>looks</em> like
a married man, we asked the cautious woman if we resembled Rebels.
At last, convinced that we were veritable Yankees, she gave us
breakfast, and sent one of the children with us to a sunny hillside
among the pines, where we slept off the weariness and soreness caused
by the night's march of sixteen miles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Among Union Bushwhackers.</div>

<p>At evening a number of friends visited us. As they were not merely
Rebel deserters, but Union bushwhackers also, we scanned them with
curiosity; for we had been wont to regard bushwhackers, of either
side, with vague, undefined horror.</p>

<p>These men were walking arsenals. Each had a trusty rifle, one or
two navy revolvers, a great bowie knife, haversack, and canteen.
Their manners were quiet, their faces honest, and one had a voice of
rare sweetness. As he stood tossing his baby in the air, with his
little daughter clinging to his skirt, he looked</p>

<div class="poem">
   <div class="stanza">
      &mdash;&mdash;"the mildest-mannered man,<br />
      That ever scuttled ship or cut a throat."
   </div>
</div>

<p>He and his neighbors had adopted this mode of life, because
determined not to fight against the old flag. They would not attempt
the uncertain journey to our lines, leaving their families in the
country of the enemy. Ordinarily very quiet and rational, whenever
the war was spoken of, their eyes emitted that peculiar glare which
I had observed, years before, in Kansas, and which seems inseparable
from the hunted man. They said: </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Two Union Soldiers "Lying Out."</div>

<p>"When the Rebels let us alone, we let them alone; when they come
out to hunt us, we hunt them! They know that we are in earnest, and
that before they can kill any one of us, he will break a hole in
the ice large enough to drag two or three of them along with him.
At night we sleep in the bush. When we go home by day, our children
stand out on picket. They and our wives bring food to us in the
woods. When the Guards are coming out, some of the Union members
usually inform us beforehand; then we collect twenty or thirty men,
find the best ground we can, and, if they discover us, fight them.
But a number of skirmishes have taught them to be very wary about
attacking us."</p>

<p>In this dreary mode of life they seemed to find a certain
fascination. While we took supper at the house of one of them, eight
bushwhackers, armed to the teeth, stood outside on guard. For once,
at least, enjoying what Macbeth vainly coveted, we took our meal in
peace.</p>

<p>Two of them were United States volunteers, who had come stealthily
home on furlough, from our army in Tennessee. They were the first
Union soldiers we had seen at liberty for nearly two years. Their
faces were very welcome, and their worn, soiled uniforms were to our
eyes the reflection of heaven's own blue. Our friends urged us to
remain, one of them saying:</p>

<p>"The snow is deep on the Blue Ridge and the Alleghanies; the
Rebels can easily trace you; the guerrillas are unusually vigilant,
and it is very unsafe to attempt crossing the mountains at present.
I started for Knoxville three weeks ago, and, after walking fifty
miles, was compelled to turn back. Stay with us until the snow is
gone, and the Guards less on the alert. We will each of us take two
of you under our special charge, and feed and shelter you until next
May, if you desire it." </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Two Escaping Rebel Deserters.</div>

<p>The Blue Ridge was still twenty-five miles away, and we determined
to push on to a point where we could look the danger, if danger there
were, directly in the face. The bushwhackers, therefore, piloted
us through the darkness and the bitter cold for seven miles. At
midnight, we reached the dwelling of a Union man. He said:</p>

<p>"As the house is unsafe, I shall be compelled to put you in my
barn. You will find two Rebel deserters sleeping there."</p>

<p>The barn was upon a high hill. We burrowed among the husks,
at first to the infinite alarm of the deserters, who thought the
Philistines were upon them. While we shivered in the darkness, they
told us that they had come from Petersburg&mdash;more than five
hundred miles&mdash;and been three months on the journey. They had
found friends all the way, among negroes and Union men. Ragged,
dirty, and penniless, they said, very quietly, that they were going
to reach the Yankee lines, or die in the attempt.</p>

<p>Before daylight our host visited us, and finding that we suffered
from the weather, placed us in a little warm storehouse, close
beside the public road. To our question, whether the Guards had ever
searched it, he replied:</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, frequently, but they never happened to find anybody."</p>

<div class="sidenote">An Energetic Invalid.</div>

<p>After we were snugly ensconced in quilts and corn-stalks, Davis
said:</p>

<p>"What an appalling journey still stretches before us! I fear the
lamp of my energy is nearly burned out."</p>

<p>I could not wonder at his despondency. For several years he had
been half an invalid, suffering from a spinal affection. For weeks
before leaving Salisbury, he was often compelled, of an afternoon, to
lie upon his bunk of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
straw with blinding headache, and every nerve quivering with pain.
"Junius" and myself frequently said: "Davis's courage is unbounded,
but he can never live to walk to Knoxville."</p>

<p>The event proved us false prophets. Nightly he led our
party&mdash;always the last to pause and the first to start. His lamp
of energy was so far from being exhausted that, before he reached our
lines, he broke down every man in the party. I expect to suffer to my
dying day from the killing pace of that energetic invalid.</p>

<p class="quotdate">XIV. <i>Saturday, December 31.</i></p>

perilous. </p>

<p>Our emaciated condition, hard labor, and the bracing mountain
air, conspired to make us ravenous. In quantity, the pork and
corn-bread which we devoured was almost miraculous; in quality, it
seemed like the nectar and ambrosia of the immortal gods. It was far
better adapted to our necessities than the daintiest luxuries of
civilization. In California, Australia, and Colorado goldmines, on
the New Orleans <span lang="fr">lev&eacute;e</span>, and wherever
else the most trying physical labor is to be performed, pork and
corn-bread have been found the best articles of food.</p>

<p>The Loyalists were all ready to feed, shelter, and direct us, but
reluctant to accompany us far from their homes. They would say:</p>

<p>"You need no guides; the road is so plain, that you cannot
possibly miss it."</p>

<p>But midnight journeys among the narrow lanes and obscure
mountain-paths had taught us that we could miss any road whatever
which was not inclosed upon both sides by fences too high for
climbing. Therefore, we insisted upon pilots.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Money Concealed in Clothing.</div>

<p>Fortunately, I had left Salisbury with a one-hundred-dollar United
States note concealed under the hem of each leg of my pantaloons,
just above the instep, and two more sewn in the lining of my coat. I
had in my portmonnaie

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
fifty dollars in Northern bank-notes, five dollars in gold, and a
hundred dollars in Confederate currency. Davis brought away about the
same amount. We should have left it with our fellow-prisoners, but
for the probability of being recaptured and confined, where money
would serve us in our extremest need. Now it enabled us to remunerate
amply both our white and black friends. Sometimes the mountaineers
would say:</p>

<p>"We do not do these things for money. We have fed and assisted
hundreds of refugees and escaping prisoners, but never received a
cent for it."</p>

<p>Those whom they befriended were usually penniless. We appreciated
their kindness none the less because fortunate enough to be able to
recompense them. They were unable to resist the argument that, when
our forces came, they would need "green-backs" to purchase coffee.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Imminent Peril of Union Citizens.</div>

<p>Every man who gave us a meal, sheltered us in his house or barn,
pointed out a refuge in the woods, or directed us one mile upon our
journey, did it at the certainty, if discovered, of being imprisoned,
or forced into the Rebel army, whether sick or well, and at the risk
of having his house burned over his head. In many cases, discovery
would have resulted in his death by shooting, or hanging in sight of
his own door.</p>

<p>During our whole journey we entered only one house inhabited by
white Unionists, which had never been plundered by Home Guards or
Rebel guerrillas. Almost every loyal family had given to the Cause
some of its nearest and dearest. We were told so frequently&mdash;"My
father was killed in those woods;" or, "The guerrillas shot my
brother in that ravine," that, finally, these tragedies made little
impression upon us. The mountaineers never seemed conscious that
they were doing any heroic or self-sacrificing thing. Their very
sufferings</p>

<p class="continued">had greatly intensified their love for the Union,
and their faith in its ultimate triumph.</p>

<p>Drowsily wondering at our capacity for sleep, we dozed through the
first day of the New Year, and the fifteenth of our liberty. After
dark we spent two hours in the house before the log fire. The good
woman had one son already escaped to the North&mdash;a fresh link
which bound her mother-heart to that ideal paradise. She fed us,
mended our clothing, and parted from us with the heartiest "God bless
you!"</p>

<p>Her youngest born, a lad of eleven years, accompanied us five
miles to the house of a Unionist, who received us without leaving his
bed. He gave us such minute information about the faint, obscure road
that we found little difficulty in keeping it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fording Creeks at Midnight.</div>

<p>Through the biting air we pressed rapidly up the narrow valley
of a clear, tumbling mountain stream, whose frowning banks, several
hundred feet in hight, were covered with pines and hemlocks. In
twelve miles the road crossed the creek twenty-nine times. Instead
of bridges were fords for horsemen and wagons, and foot-logs for
pedestrians. Cold and stiff, we discovered that crossing the smooth,
icy logs in the darkness was a hazardous feat. Wolfe was particularly
lame, and slipped several times into the icy torrent, but managed to
flounder out without much delay. He endured with great serenity all
our suggestions, that even though water was his native element, he
had a very eccentric taste to prefer swimming to walking, in that
state of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>At one crossing the log was swept away. We wandered up and down
the stream, which was about a hundred feet wide, but could find not
even the hair which Mahomet discovered to be the bridge over the
bottomless pit. But as canoes are older than ships, so legs are more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
primitive than bridges. We e'en plunged in, waist deep, and waded
through, among the cakes of floating ice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"Looped and Windowed Raggedness."</div>

<p>Our wardrobes were suffering quite as much as our persons. We did
not carry looking-glasses, so I am not able to speak of myself; but
my colleague was a subject for a painter. Any one seeing him must
have been convinced that he was made up for the occasion; that his
looped and windowed raggedness never could have resulted from any
natural combination of circumstances. The fates seemed to decree that
as "Junius" went naked into the Confederacy (leaving most of his
wardrobe on deposit at the bottom of the Mississippi), he should come
out of it in the same condition.</p>

<p>Overcoat he had none. Pantaloons had been torn to shreds and
tatters by the brambles and thorn-bushes. He had a hat which was
not all a hat. It was given to him, after he had lost his own
in a Rebel barn, by a warm-hearted African, as a small tribute
from the Intelligent Contraband to his old friend the Reliable
Gentleman&mdash;by an African who felt with the most touching
propriety that it would be a shame for any correspondent of
<cite>The Tribune</cite> to go bareheaded as long as a single negro in
America was the owner of a hat! It was a white wool relic of the
old-red-sandstone period, with a sugar-loaf crown, and a broad brim
drawn down closely over his ears, like the bonnet of an Esquimaux.</p>

<p>His boots were a stupendous refutation of the report that leather
was scarce among the Rebels. I understood it to be no figure of
rhetoric, but the result of actual and exact measurement, which
induced him to call them the "Seven-Leaguers." The small portion
of his body, which was visible between the tops of his boots and
the bottom of his hat, was robed in an old gray quilt of Secession
proclivities; and taken for all in all, with his pale, nervous face
and his remarkable costume, he looked like a cross between the Genius
of Intellectuality and a Rebel bushwhacker! </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span></p>

<p>Before daylight, we shiveringly tapped on the door of a house at
the foot of the Blue Ridge.</p>

<p>"Come in," was the welcome response.</p>

<p>Entering, we found a woman sitting by the log fire. Beginning to
introduce ourselves, she interrupted:</p>

<p>"O, I know all about you. You are Yankee prisoners. Your friends
who passed last evening told us you were coming, and I have been
sitting up all night for you. Come to the fire and dry your
clothes."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stories about the War.</div>

<p>For two hours we listened to her tales of the war. The history
of almost every Union family was full of romance. Each unstoried
mountain stream had its incidents of daring, of sagacity, and of
faithfulness; and almost every green hill had been bathed in that
scarlet dew from which ever springs the richest and the ripest
fruit.</p>

<p>Concealment here was difficult; so we were taken to the house of
a neighbor, who also was waiting to welcome us. He took us to his
storehouse, right by the road-side.</p>

<p>"The Guard," said he, "searched this building last Thursday,
unsuccessfully, and are hardly likely to try it again just yet."</p>

<p>Soon, lying near a fire upon a warm feather-bed, we wooed the
drowsy god with all the success which the hungry Salisbury vermin,
sticking closer than brothers, would permit.</p>

<p class="quotdate">XVI. <i>Monday, January 2.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Climbing the Blue Ridge.</div>

<p>Before night the guide returned from conducting Boothby's party,
and assured us that the coast was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
clear. After dark, invigorated by tea and apple brandy, we followed
our pilot by devious paths up the steep, fir-clad, piny slope of the
Blue Ridge.</p>

<p>The view from the summit is beautiful and impressive; but for our
weariness and anxiety, we should have enjoyed it very keenly.</p>

<p>A few weeks before, the Unionist now leading us had sent his
little daughter of twelve years, alone, by night, fifteen miles over
the mountains, to warn some escaping Union prisoners that the Guard
had gained a clue to their whereabouts. They received the warning in
season to find a place of safety before their pursuers came.</p>

<p>We were now on the west side of the Ridge. A heavy rain began to
fall, and, though soaked and weary, we were glad to have our tracks
obliterated, and thus be insured against pursuit.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The labor we delight in physics pain;"</p></div>

<p>but in this case the effort was so arduous that the panacea was
not very effective. Thomas Starr King tells the story of a little
man, who, being asked his weight, replied:</p>

<p>"Ordinarily, a hundred and twenty pounds; but when I'm mad, I
weigh a ton!"</p>

<p>I think any one of our wet, blistered feet, which, at every step,
sunk deep into the slush, would have counterbalanced his whole body!
Like millstones we dragged them up hill after hill, and through the
long valleys which stretched drearily between. Though not hungering
after the flesh-pots of Egypt, we still thought, half regretfully,
of our squalid Salisbury quarters, where we had at least a roof to
shelter us, and a bunk of straw. But we needed no injunction to
remember Lot's wife; for a pillar of salt would have represented a
fabulous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
sum of money in the currency of the Rebels; and we had no desire to
swell their scanty revenues or supply their impoverished commissary
department.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Crossing the New River at Midnight.</div>

<p>At midnight we reached New River, two hundred and fifty yards
wide. Our guide took us over, one at a time, behind him upon his
horse. We were probably five hundred miles above the point where this
river, as the Great Kanawha, unites with the Ohio; but it was the
first stream we had found running northward, and its soft, rippling
song of home and freedom was very sweet to our ears. Already our
Promised Land stretched before us, and the shining river seemed
a pathway of light to its hither boundary. Better than Abana and
Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, this was the Jordan, flowing toward all
we loved and longed for. It revived the great world of work and of
life which had faded almost to fable.</p>

<p>At two in the morning we reached the house of a stanch Unionist,
which nestled romantically in the green valley, inclosed on all sides
by dark mountains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hospitality and Oratory Combined.</div>

<p>Our new friend, herculean in frame and with a heavy-tragedy voice,
came out where we sat, dripping and dreary, under an old cotton-gin,
and addressed us in a pompous strain, worthy of Sergeant Buzfuz:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said he, "there are, unfortunately, at my house
to-night two wayfarers, who are Rebels and traitors. If they knew of
your presence, it would be my inevitable and eternal ruin. Therefore,
unable to extend to you such hospitalities as I could wish, I bid you
welcome to all which <em>can</em> be furnished by so poor a man as I. I will
place you in my barn, which is warm, and filled with fodder. I will
bring you food and apple brandy. In the morning, when these infernal
scoundrels are gone, I will entertain you under my family roof.
Gentlemen, I have been a Union man from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
beginning, and I shall be a Union man to the end. I had three sons;
one died in a Rebel hospital; one was killed at the battle of the
Wilderness, fighting (against his will) for the Southern cause; the
third, thank God! is in the Union lines."</p>

<p>Here the father overcame the orator; and, with the conjunction
of apple brandy, corn bread, and quilts, we were soon asleep in the
barn. </p>

<p>At nine in the morning our host awakened us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Over Mountains and Through Ravines.</div>

<p>"Gentlemen, I trust you have slept well. The enemy has gone, and
breakfast waits. I call you early, because I want to take you out
of North Carolina into Tennessee, where I will show you a place of
refuge infinitely safer than this."</p>

<p>For the first time since leaving Salisbury we traveled by
daylight. Our guide led us deviously through fields, and up almost
perpendicular ascents, where the rarefied air compelled us frequently
to stop for breath.</p>

<p>We dragged our weary feet up one hill, down another, through
ravines of almost impenetrable laurels, swinging across the streams
by the snowy, pendent boughs, only to find another appalling hight
rising before us. Nothing but the hope of freedom enabled us to
keep on our feet. Once, when near a public road, our guide suddenly
whispered.</p>

<p>"Hist! Drop to the ground instantly!"</p>

<p>Lying behind logs, we saw two or three horse-teams and sleds pass
by, and heard the conversation of the drivers.</p>

<p>Our pilot was not agitated, for, like all the Union mountaineers,
danger had been so long a part of his every-day existence, that he
had no physical nervousness. But it was reported that the Guards
would be out to-day, so he was very wary and vigilant. We crossed the
road in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
the Indian mode, walking in single file, each man treading in the
footsteps of his immediate predecessor. No casual observer would have
suspected that it was the track of more than one man.</p>

<p>At 4 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, we entered Tennessee, which,
like the passage of the New River, seemed another long stride toward
home. Approaching a settlement, we went far around through the
woods, persuading ourselves that we were unobserved. A mile beyond
we reached a small log house, where our friend was known, and a
blooming, matronly woman, with genial eyes, welcomed us.</p>

<p>"Come in, all. I am very glad to see you. I thought you must be
Yankees when I heard of your approach, about half an hour ago."</p>

<p>"How did you hear?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mistaken for Confederate Guards.</div>

<p>"A good many young men are lying out in this neighborhood, and
my son is one of them. He has not slept in the house for two years.
He always carries his rifle. At first, I was opposed to it, but now
I am glad to have him. They may murder him any day, and if they do,
I at least want him to kill some of the traitors first. Nobody can
approach this settlement, day or night, without being seen by some of
these young men, always on the watch. The Guard have come in twice,
at midnight, as fast as they could ride; but the news traveled before
them, and they found the birds flown. When you appeared in sight,
the boys took you for Rebels. My son and two others, lying behind
logs, had their rifles drawn on you not more than three hundred yards
away. They were very near shooting you, when they discovered that you
had no arms, and concluded you must be the right sort of people. In
the distance you look like Home Guards&mdash;part of you dressed as
citizens, one in Rebel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
uniform, and two wearing Yankee overcoats. You are unsafe traveling a
single mile through this region, without sending word beforehand who
you are."</p>

<p>After dark we were shown to a barn, where we wrapped ourselves
in quilts. During the last twenty-four hours we had journeyed
twenty-five miles, equal to fifty upon level roads, and our eye-lids
were very heavy.</p>

<p class="quotdate">XVIII. <i>Wednesday, January 4.</i></p>

<p>This settlement was intensely loyal, and admirably picketed by
Union women, children, and bushwhackers. We dined with the wife of a
former inmate of Castle Thunder. She told us that Lafayette Jones,
whose escape from that prison I have already recorded, remained in
the Rebel army only a few days, deserting from it to the Union lines,
and then coming back to his Tennessee home.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Rebel Guerrilla Killed.</div>

<p>The Rebel guerrilla captain who originally captured him was
notoriously cruel, had burned houses, murdered Union men, and abused
helpless women. He took from Jones two hundred dollars in gold,
promising to forward it to his family, but never did so. After
reaching home, Jones sent a message to him that he must refund the
money at once, or be killed wherever found. Jones finally sought him.
As they met, the guerrilla drew a revolver and fired, but without
wounding his antagonist. Thereupon Jones shot him dead on his own
threshold. The Union people justified and applauded the deed. Jones
was afterward captain in a loyal Tennessee regiment. His father had
died in a Richmond dungeon, one of his brothers in an Alabama prison,
and a second had been hung by the Rebels.</p>

<p>The woman told us that another guerrilla, peculiarly obnoxious to
the Loyalists, had disappeared early in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
November. A few days before we arrived, his bones were found in
the woods, with twenty-one bullet-holes through his clothing. His
watch and money were still undisturbed in his pocket. Vengeance, not
avarice, stimulated his destroyers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Meeting a former Fellow-Prisoner.</div>

<p>Here we met another of our Castle Thunder fellow-prisoners, named
Guy. The Richmond authorities knew he was a Union bushwhacker, and
had strong evidence against him, which would have cost him his life
if brought to trial. But he, too, under an assumed name, enlisted in
the Rebel army, deserted, returned to Tennessee, and resumed his old
pursuit as a hunter of men with new zeal and vigor.</p>

<p>He and his companion were now armed with sixteen-shooter rifles,
revolvers, and bowie-knives. Guy's father and brother had both been
killed by the guerrillas, and he was bitter and unsparing. If he ever
fell into Rebel hands again, his life was not worth a rush-light.
But he was merry and jocular as if he had never heard of the King of
Terrors. I asked him how he now regarded his Richmond adventures. He
replied:</p>

<p>"I would not take a thousand dollars in gold for the experience
I had while in prison; but I would not endure it again for ten
thousand."</p>

<p>Guy and his comrade were supposed to be "lying out," which
suggested silent and stealthy movements; but on leaving us they
went yelling, singing, and screaming up the valley, whooping like a
whole tribe of Indians. Occasionally they fired their rifles, as if
their vocal organs were not noisy enough. It was ludicrously strange
deportment for hunted fugitives.</p>

<p>"Guy always goes through the country in that way," said the woman.
"He is very reckless and fearless. The Rebels know it, and give him a
wide field. He has killed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
a good many of them, first and last, and no doubt they will murder
him, sooner or later, as they did his father."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alarm About Rebel Cavalry.</div>

<p>At night, just as we were comfortably asleep in the barn, our host
awakened us, saying:</p>

<p>"Five Rebel cavalry are reported approaching this neighborhood,
with three hundred more behind them, coming over the mountains from
North Carolina. I think it is true, but am not certain. I am so well
known as a Union man, that, if they do come, they will search my
premises thoroughly. There is another barn, much more secluded, a
mile farther up the valley, where you will be safer than here, and
will compromise nobody if discovered. If they arrive, you shall be
informed before they can reach you."</p>

<p>Coleridge did not believe in ghosts, because he had seen too many
of them. So we were skeptical concerning the Rebel cavalry, having
heard too much of it. But we went to the other barn, and in its
ample straw-loft found a North Carolina refugee, with whom we slept
undisturbed. He deemed this place much safer than his home&mdash;a
gratifying indication to us that the danger was growing small by
degrees.</p>

<p class="quotdate">XIX. <i>Thursday, January 5.</i></p>

<p>This morning, the good woman whose barn had sheltered us mended
our tattered clothing. Her husband was a soldier in the Union
service. I asked her:</p>

<p>"How do you live and support your family?"</p>

<p>"Very easily," she replied. "Last year, I did all my own
housework, and weaving, spinning, and knitting, and raised over a
hundred bushels of corn, with no assistance whatever except from this
little girl, eleven years old. The hogs run in the woods during the
summer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
feeding themselves; so we are in no danger of starvation."</p>

<p>Boothby's company, enhanced by the two Rebel deserters from
Petersburg, and a young conscript, formerly one of our prison-guards
at Salisbury, here rejoined us. Our entire party, numbering ten,
started again at 3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span></p>

<p>The road was over Stony Mountain, very rocky and steep. As
we halted wearily upon its summit, we overlooked a great waste
of mountains, intersected with green valleys of pine and fir,
threaded by silver streams. Our guide assured us that, at Carter's
D&eacute;p&ocirc;t, one hundred and ten miles east of Knoxville, we
should find Union troops. Soon after dark, to our disappointment and
indignation, he declared that he must turn back without a moment's
delay. His long-deferred explanation that the young wife, whom he had
left at his lonely log house, was about to endure</p>

<div class="poem">
   <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i0">"The pleasing punishment which women bear,"</span>
   </div>
</div>

<p class="continued">mollified our wrath, and we bade him good-by.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Stanch Old Unionist.</div>

<p>After dark we found our way, deviously, around several dwellings,
to the house of an old Union man. With his wife and three bouncing
daughters, he heartily welcomed us:</p>

<p>"I am very glad to see you; I have been looking for you these two
hours."</p>

<p>"Why did you expect us?"</p>

<p>"We learned yesterday that there were ten Yankees, one in red
breeches and a Rebel uniform, over the mountain. Girls, make a fire
in the kitchen, and get supper for these gentlemen!"</p>

<p>While we discussed the meal and a great bucket of rosy apples
before the roaring fire, our host&mdash;silver-haired, deep-chested,
brawny-limbed, a splendid specimen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
of physical manhood&mdash;poured out his heart. He was devoted to the
Union with a zeal passing the love of women. How intensely he hated
the Rebels! How his eyes flashed and dilated as he talked of the
old flag! How perfect his faith that he should live to see it again
waving triumphantly on his native mountains! One of his sons had died
fighting for his country, and two others were still in the Union
army.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Most Dangerous Point.</div>

<p>The old gentleman piloted us through the deep woods, for three
miles, to a friendly house. We were now near a rendezvous of Rebel
guerrillas, reported to be without conscience and without mercy.
Their settlement was known through that whole region as "Little
Richmond." We must pass within a quarter of a mile of them. It was
feared that they might have pickets out, and the point was deemed
more dangerous than any since leaving Salisbury.</p>

<p>Our new friend, though an invalid, promptly rose from his bed to
guide us through the danger. His wife greeted us cordially, but was
extremely apprehensive&mdash;darting to and from the door, and in
conversation suddenly pausing to listen. When we started, she said,
taking both my hands in hers:</p>

<p>"May God prosper you, and carry you safely through to those
you love. But you must be very cautious. Less than six weeks ago,
my two brothers started for the North by the same route; and when
they reached Crab Orchard, the Rebel guerrillas captured them, and
murdered them in cold blood."</p>

<p>After leading us two miles, the guide stopped, and when all came
up, he whispered:</p>

<p>"We are approaching the worst place. Let no man speak a word. Step
lightly as possible, while I keep as far ahead as you can see me. If
you hear any noise, dart

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
out of sight at once. Should I be
discovered with you, it would be certain death to me. If found alone,
I can tell some story about sickness in my family."</p>

<p>We crept softly behind him for two miles. Then, leading us through a
rocky pasture into the road, he said:</p>

<p>"Thank God! I have brought another party of the right sort of people
past Little Richmond in safety. My health is broken, and I shall not
live long; but it is a great consolation to know that I have been
able to help some men who love the Union made by our fathers."</p>

<p>Directing us to a stanch Unionist, a few miles beyond, he returned
home.</p>

<p>At three in the morning, we reached our destination. Davis and
Boothby did pioneer duty, going forward to the house, where they were
received by a clamor of dogs, which made the valleys ring. After a
whispered conference with the host, they returned and said:</p>

<p>"There is a Rebel traveler spending the night here. We are to stay in
the barn until morning, when he will be gone."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The All-devouring Vermin.</div>

<p>We burrowed in the warm hay-mow, and vainly essayed to sleep. The
all-devouring vermin by this time swarmed upon us, poisoning our
blood and stimulating every nerve, as we tossed wearily until long
after daylight.</p>

<p class="quotdate">XX. <i>Friday, January 6.</i></p>

<p>At nine o'clock this morning our host came to the hay-loft and
awoke us:</p>

<p>"My troublesome guest is gone; walk down to breakfast."</p>

<p>He was educated, intelligent, and had been a leader among the
"Conservative" or Union people, until compelled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
to acquiesce, nominally, in the war. His house and family were
pleasant. But while we now began to approach civilization, the
Union lines steadily receded. He informed us that we would find no
loyal troops east of Jonesboro, ninety-eight miles from Knoxville,
and probably none east of Greenville, seventy-four miles from
Knoxville.</p>

<p>"But," said he, "you are out of the woods for the present. You
are on the border of the largest Union settlement in all the Rebel
States. You may walk for twenty-four miles by daylight on the public
road. Look out for strangers, Home Guards, or Rebel guerrillas; but
you will find every man, woman, and child, who lives along the route,
a stanch and faithful friend."</p>

<p>With light hearts we started down the valley. It seemed strange
to travel the public road by daylight, visit houses openly, and look
people in the face.</p>

<p>Our way was on the right bank of the Watauga, a broad, flashing
stream, walled in by abrupt cliffs, covered with pines and hemlocks.
A woman on horseback, with her little son on foot, accompanied us for
several miles, saying:</p>

<p>"If you travel alone, you are in danger of being shot for Rebel
guerrillas."</p>

<div class="sidenote">More Union Soldiers.</div>

<p>In the evening a Union man rowed us across the stream. On
the left bank our eyes were gladdened by three of our boys in
blue&mdash;United States soldiers at home on furlough. Seeing us in
the distance, they leveled their rifles, but soon discovered that we
were not foes.</p>

<p>Our host for the night beguiled the evening hours with stories of
the war; and again we enjoyed the luxury of beds. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span></p>

<p class="quotdate">XXI. <i>Saturday, January 7.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Well-Fortified Refuge.</div>

<p>A friend piloted us eight miles over the rough, snowy mountains,
avoiding public roads. In the afternoon, we found shelter at a white
frame house, nestling among the mountains, and fronted by a natural
lawn, dotted with firs.</p>

<p>Here, for the first time, we were entirely safe. Any possible
Rebel raid must come from the south side of the river. The house
was on the north bank of the stream, which was too much swollen for
fording, and the only canoe within five miles was fastened on our
shore. Thus fortified on front, flank, and rear, we took our ease in
the pleasant, home-like farmhouse.</p>

<p>Near the dwelling was a great spring, of rare beauty. Within an
area of twelve feet, a dozen streams, larger than one's arm, came
gushing and boiling up through snow-white sand. By the aid of a great
fire, and an enormous iron kettle, we boiled all our clothing, and
at last vanquished the troublesome enemies which, brought from the
prison, had so long disturbed our peace.</p>

<p>Then, bathing in the icy waters, we came out renewed, like the
Syrian leper, and, in soft, clean beds, enjoyed the sweet sleep of
childhood.</p>

<p class="quotdate">XXII. <i>Sunday, January 8.</i></p>

<p>A new guide took us eight miles to a log barn in the woods. After
dining among, but not upon, the husks, we started again, an old lady
of sixty guiding us through the woods toward her house. Age had not
withered her, nor custom staled, for she walked at a pace which made
it difficult to keep in sight of her.</p>

<p>At dark, in the deep pines, behind her lonely dwelling, we kindled
a fire, supped, and, with fifteen or twenty companions, who had
joined us so noiselessly that they seemed to spring from earth, we
started on. </p>

<div class="sidenote">Dan Ellis, the Union Guide.</div>

<p>For many months before leaving prison, we had been familiar with
the name of <span class="smcap">Dan Ellis</span>&mdash;a famous Union
guide, who, since the beginning of the war, had done nothing but
conduct loyal men to our lines.</p>

<p>Ellis is a hero, and his life a romance. He had taken through,
in all, more than four thousand persons. He had probably seen
more adventure&mdash;in fights and races with the Rebels, in long
journeys, sometimes bare-footed and through the snow, or swimming
rivers full of floating ice&mdash;than any other person living.</p>

<p>He never lost but one man, who was swooped up through his own
heedlessness. The party had traveled eight or ten days, living
upon nothing but parched corn. Dan insisted that a man could walk
twenty-five miles a day through snow upon parched corn just as well
as upon any other diet&mdash;if he only thought so. I feel bound to
say that I have tried it and do not think so. This person held the
same opinion. He revolted against the parched-corn diet, vowing that
he would go to the first house and get an honest meal, if he was
captured for it. He went to the first house, obtained the meal, and
was captured.</p>

<p>After we had traveled fifty miles, everybody said to us, "If you
can only find Dan Ellis, and do just as he tells you, you will be
certain to get through."</p>

<div class="sidenote">In Good Hands at Last.</div>

<p>We <em>did</em> find Dan Ellis. On this Sunday night, one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
hundred and thirty-four miles from our lines, greatly broken down,
we reached a point on the road, waited for two hours, when along
came Dan Ellis, with a party of seventy men&mdash;refugees, Rebel
deserters, Union soldiers returning from their homes within the
enemy's lines, and escaping prisoners. About thirty of them were
mounted and twenty armed.</p>

<p>Like most men of action, Dan was a man of few words. When our
story had been told him, he said to his comrades:</p>

<p>"Boys, here are some gentlemen who have escaped from Salisbury,
and are almost dead from the journey. They are our people. They have
suffered in our Cause. They are going to their homes in our lines. We
can't ride and let these men walk. Get down off your horses, and help
them up."</p>

<p>Down they came, and up we went; and then we pressed along at a
terrible pace.</p>

<p>In low conversation, as we rode through the darkness, I learned
from Dan and his companions something of his strange, eventful
history. At the outbreak of the war, he was a mechanic in East
Tennessee. After once going through the mountains to the Union lines,
he displayed rare capacity for woodcraft, and such vigilance, energy,
and wisdom, that he fell naturally into the pursuit of a pilot.</p>

<p>Six or eight of his men, who had been with him from the beginning,
were almost equally familiar with the routes. They lived near him,
in Carter County, Tennessee, in open defiance of the Rebels. When at
home, they usually slept in the woods, and never parted from their
arms for a single moment.</p>

<p>As the Rebels would show them no mercy, they could not afford to
be captured. For three years there had </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span></p>

<p class="continued">been a standing offer of five thousand dollars
for Dan Ellis's head. During that period, except when within our
lines, he had never permitted his Henry rifle, which would fire
sixteen times without reloading, to go beyond the reach of his
hand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An Unequal Battle&mdash;Ellis's Bravery.</div>

<p>Once, when none of his comrades, except Lieutenant Treadaway, were
with him, fourteen of the Rebels came suddenly upon them. Ellis and
Treadaway dropped behind logs and began to fire their rifles. As the
enemy pressed them, they fell slowly back into a forest, continuing
to shoot from behind trees. The unequal skirmish lasted three hours.
Several Rebels were wounded, and at last they retreated, leaving the
two determined Unionists unharmed and masters of the field.</p>

<p>Dan usually made the trip to our lines once in three or four
weeks, leading through from forty to five hundred persons. Before
starting, he and his comrades would make a raid upon the Rebels in
some neighboring county, take from them all the good horses they
could find, and, after reaching Knoxville, sell them to the United
States quartermaster.</p>

<p>Thus they obtained a livelihood, though nothing more. The refugees
and escaping prisoners were usually penniless, and Ellis, whose
sympathies flowed toward all loyal men like water, was compelled to
feed them during the entire journey. He always remunerated Union
citizens for provisions purchased from them.</p>

<p>To-night was so cold, that our sore, lame joints would hardly
support us upon our horses. Dan's rapid marching was the chief secret
of his success. He seemed determined to keep at least one day ahead
of all Rebel pursuers.</p>

<p>Now that we were safe in his hands, I accompanied the party
mechanically, with no further questions or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
anxiety about routes; but I chanced to hear Treadaway ask him:</p>

<p>"Don't you suppose the Nolechucky is too high for us to ford?"</p>

<p>"Very likely," replied Dan; "we will stop and inquire of
Barnet."</p>

<p>Upon the mule which I rode, a sack of corn served for a saddle.
I was not accomplished in the peculiar gymnastics required to sit
easily upon it and keep it in place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lost!&mdash;A Perilous Blunder.</div>

<p>Thirsty and feverish, I stopped at the crossing of Rock Creek
for a draught of water and to adjust the corn-sack. Attempting to
remount, I was as stiff and awkward as an octogenarian, and my
restive mule would not stand for a moment. I finally succeeded in
climbing upon his back two or three minutes after the last horseman
disappeared up the bank.</p>

<p>We had been traveling across forests, over hills, through swamps,
without regard to thoroughfares; but I rode carelessly on, supposing
that my mule's instinct would keep him on the fresh scent of the
cavalcade. When we had jogged along for ten minutes, awakening from
a little reverie, I listened vainly to hear the footfalls of the
horses. All was silent. I dismounted, and examined the half-frozen
road, but no hoof-marks could be seen upon it.</p>

<p>I was lost! It might mean recapture&mdash;it might mean
reimprisonment and death, for the terms were nearly synonymous. I
was ignorant about the roads, and whether I was in a Union or Rebel
settlement.</p>

<p>To search for that noiseless, stealthy party would be useless;
so I rode back to the creek, tied my mule to a laurel in the
dense thicket, and sat down upon a log, pondering on my stupid
heedlessness, which seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
likely to meet its just reward. I remembered that Davis owed his
original capture to a mule, and wondered if the same cause was about
to produce for me a like result.</p>

<p>Mentally anathematizing my long-eared brute, I gave him a part of
the corn, and threw myself down behind a log, directly beside the
road. This would enable me to hear the horse's feet of any one who
might return for me. In a few minutes I was sound asleep.</p>

<p>When awakened by the cold, my watch told me that it was three
o'clock. Running to and fro in the thicket until my blood was warmed,
I resumed my position behind the log, and slept until daylight was
gleaming through the forest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Most Fortunate Encounter.</div>

<p>Walking back to the creek, I reconnoitered a log dwelling, so
small and humble that its occupant was probably loyal. In a few
minutes, through the early dawn, an old man, with a sack of corn upon
his shoulder, came out of the house. He evinced no surprise at seeing
me. Looking earnestly into his eyes, I asked him:</p>

<p>"Are you a Union man or a Secessionist?" He replied:</p>

<p>"I don't know who you are; but I am a Union man, and always have
been."</p>

<p>"I am a stranger and in trouble. I charge you to tell me the
truth."</p>

<p>"I do tell you the truth, and I have two sons in the United States
army."</p>

<p>His manner appeared sincere, and he carried a letter of
recommendation in his open, honest face. I told him my awkward
predicament. He reassured me at once.</p>

<p>"I know Dan Ellis as well as my own brother. No truer man ever
lived. What route was he going to take?" </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span></p>

<p>"I heard him say something about Barnet's."</p>

<p>"That is a ford only five miles from here. Barnet is one of the
right sort of people. This road will take you to his house. Good-by,
my friend, and don't get separated from your party again."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rejoining Dan and his Party.</div>

<p>I certainly did not need the last injunction. Reaching the ford,
Barnet told me that our party had spent several hours in crossing,
and was encamped three miles ahead. He took me over the river in his
canoe, my mule swimming behind. Half a mile down the road. I met
Ellis and Treadaway.</p>

<p>"Ah ha!" said Dan, "we were looking for you. I told the boys not
to be uneasy. There are men in our crowd who would have blundered
upon some Rebel, told all about us, and so alarmed the country and
brought out the Home Guards; but I knew you were discreet enough to
take care of yourself, and not endanger us. Let us breakfast at this
Union house."</p>

<p class="quotdate">XXIII. <i>Monday, January 9.</i></p>

<p>"To-day," said Dan Ellis, "we must cross the Big Butte of Rich
Mountain."</p>

<p>"How far is it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It is generally called ten miles; but I suspect it is about
fifteen, and a rather hard road at that."</p>

<p>About fifteen, and a rather hard road! It seemed fifty, and a very
<span lang="la">Via Dolorosa</span>.</p>

<p>We started at 11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> For three miles
we followed a winding creek, the horsemen on a slow trot, crossing
the stream a dozen times; the footmen keeping up as best they could,
and shivering from their frequent baths in the icy waters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Terrible Mountain March.</div>

<p>We turned up the sharp side of a snowy mountain. For hours and
hours we toiled along, up one rocky,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
pine-covered hill, down a little declivity, then up another hill,
then down again, but constantly gaining in hight. The snow was ten
inches deep. Dan averred he had never crossed the mountain when the
travel was so hard; but he pushed on, as if death were behind and
heaven before.</p>

<p>The rarity of the air at that elevation increased my pneumonic
difficulty, and rendered my breath very short. Ellis furnished me
with a horse the greater part of the way; but the hills, too steep
for riding, compelled us to climb, our poor animals following behind.
The pithy proverb, that "it is easy to walk when one leads a horse
by the bridle," was hardly true in my case, for it seemed a hundred
times to-day as if I could not possibly take another step, but must
fall out by the roadside, and let the company go on. But after my
impressive lesson of last night, I was hardly likely to halt so long
as any locomotive power remained.</p>

<p>Our men and animals, in single file, extended for more than a mile
in a weary, tortuous procession, which dragged its slow length along.
After hours which appeared interminable, and efforts which seemed
impossible, we halted upon a high ridge, brushed the snow from the
rocks, and sat down to a cold lunch, beside a clear, bright spring
which gushed vigorously from the ground. I ventured to ask:</p>

<p>"Are we near the top?"</p>

<p>"About half way up," was Dan's discouraging reply.</p>

<p>"Come, come, boys; we must pull out!" urged Davis; and, following
that irrepressible invalid, we moved forward again.</p>

<p>As we climbed hill after hill, thinking we had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
nearly reached the summit, beyond us would still rise another
mountain a little higher than the one we stood upon. They seemed to
stretch out to the crack of doom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Storm Increases the Discomforts.</div>

<p>To increase the discomfort, a violent rain came on. The very
memory of this day is wearisome. I pause, thankful to end only a
chapter, in the midst of an experience which, judged by my own
feelings, appeared likely to end life itself. </p>

</div>

<p>As I toiled, staggering, up each successive hill, it seemed that
this terrible climbing and this torturing day would never end. But
Necessity and Hope work miracles, and strength proved equal to the
hour.</p>

<p>At 4 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> the clouds broke, the sun
burst out, as we stood on the icy summit, revealing a grand view of
mountains, valleys, and streams on every side.</p>

<p>After a brief halt, we began the descent. Our path, trodden only
by refugees and prisoners, led by Dan Ellis, had been worn so deep by
the water, that, in many places, our bodies were half concealed! How
Dan rushed down those steep declivities! It was easy to follow now,
and I kept close behind him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fording Creeks in the Darkness.</div>

<p>Twilight, dusk, darkness, came on, and again the rain began to
pour down. We could not see each other five yards away. We pressed
steadily on. We reached the foot of the mountain, and were in a dark,
pine-shadowed, winding road, which frequently crossed a swollen,
foaming creek. At first Dan hunted for logs; but the darkness made
this slow work. He finally abandoned it, and, whenever we came to
a stream, plunged in up to the middle, dashed through, and rushed
on, with dripping garments. Our cavalcade and procession must have
stretched back fully three miles; but every man endeavored
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
to keep within shouting distance of his immediate predecessor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prospect of a Dreary Night.</div>

<p>"We shall camp to-night," said Dan, "at a lonely house two miles
from the foot of the mountain."</p>

<p>Reaching the place, we found that, since his last journey, this
dwelling had tumbled down, and nothing was left but a labyrinth of
timbers and boards. We laboriously propped up a section of the roof.
It proved a little protection from the dripping rain, and, while the
rest of the party slowly straggled in, Treadaway went to the nearest
Union house, to learn the condition of the country. In fifteen
minutes we heard the tramp of his returning horse, and could see a
fire-brand glimmering through the darkness.</p>

<p>"Something wrong here," said Dan. "There must be danger, or he
would not bring fire, expecting us to stay out of doors such a night
as this. What is the news, Treadaway?"</p>

<p>"Bad enough," replied the lieutenant, dismounting from his
dripping horse, carefully nursing, between two pieces of board, the
glowing firebrand. "The Rebel guerrillas are thick and vigilant. A
party of them passed here only this evening. I tell you, Dan Ellis,
we have got to keep a sharp eye out, if we don't want to be picked
up."</p>

<p>All who could find room huddled under the poorly propped roof,
which threatened to fall and crush them. Dan and his immediate
comrades, with great readiness, improvised a little camp for
themselves, so thatching it with boards and shingles that it kept
the water off their heads. They were soon asleep, grasping their
inseparable rifles and near their horses, from which they never
permitted themselves to be far away.</p>

<p>With my two journalistic friends, I deemed rest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
nearly as important as safety, for we needed to accumulate strength.
We found our way through the darkness to the nearest Union house.
There was a great fire blazing on the hearth; but the little room was
crowded with our weary and soaking companions, who had anticipated
us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sleeping Among the Husks.</div>

<p>We crossed the creek to another dwelling, where the occupant, a
life-long invalid, was intensely loyal. With his wife and little son,
he greeted us very warmly, adding:</p>

<p>"I wish I could keep you in my house; but it would not be safe.
We will give you quilts, and you may sleep among the husks in the
barn, where you will be warm and dry. If the Guards come during the
night, they will be likely to search the house first, and the boy or
the woman can probably give you warning. But, if they do find you, of
course you will tell them that we are not privy to your concealment,
because, you know, it would be a matter of life and death for me."</p>

<p>We found the husks dry and fragrant, and soon forgot our
weariness.</p>

<p class="quotdate">XXIV. <i>Tuesday, January 10.</i></p>

<p>Breakfasting before daylight, that we might not be seen leaving
the house, we sought our rendezvous. Those who had remained in camp
were a wet, cold, sorry-looking party.</p>

<p>By nine o'clock, several, who had been among the Union people in
the neighborhood, returned, and held a consultation. The accounts of
all agreed that, fifteen or twenty miles ahead, the danger was great,
and the country exceedingly difficult to pass through. Moreover, the
Union forces still appeared to recede as we approached the places
where they were reputed to be. We were now certain that there were
none at Jonesboro,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
none at Greenville, probably none east of Strawberry Plains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Turning Back in Discouragement.</div>

<p>Eight or ten of our party determined to turn back. Among them were
three Union soldiers, who had seen service and peril. But they said
to us, as they turned to retrace their steps over Rich Mountain:</p>

<p>"It is useless to go on. The party will never get through in the
world. Not a single man of it will reach Knoxville, unless he waits
till the road is clear."</p>

<p>Ellis and Treadaway listened to them with a quiet smile. The
perils ahead did not disturb our serenity, because they were so much
lighter than the perils behind. We had left horrors to which all
future possibilities were a mercy. We had looked in at the windows
of Death, and stood upon the verge of the Life To Be. We doubted not
that the difficulties were greatly magnified, and all dangers looked
infinitesimal, along the path leading toward home and freedom.</p>

<p>Among those who went back was a North Carolina citizen,
accompanied by a little son, the child of his old age. Reluctant
to trust himself again to the tender mercies of the Rebels, he was
unaccustomed to the war-path, and decided to return to the ills he
had, rather than fly to others which he knew not of. Purchasing one
of his horses, I was no longer dependent upon the kindness of Ellis
and his comrades for a steed.</p>

<p>Before noon we started, following secluded valley paths. The rain
ceased and the day was pleasant. At a Union dwelling we came upon
the hot track of eight guerrillas, who had been there only an hour
before. The Rebel-hunting instinct waxed strong within Dan, and,
taking eight of his own men, he started in fierce pursuit, leaving
Treadaway in charge of the company.</p>

<p>Before dark we reached Kelly's Gap, camping in an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
old orchard, beside a large farm-house with many ample out-buildings.
The place was now deserted. One of our guides explained:</p>

<p>"A Union man lived here, and he was hanged last year upon that
apple-tree. They cut him down, however, before he died, and he fled
from the country."</p>

<p>Tying our horses to the trees, we parched corn for supper. Fires
were kindled in the buildings, giving the place a genial appearance
as night closed in.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Rebel Prisoner Brought In.</div>

<p>After dark, Dan and his comrades returned. The whole party of
guerrillas had very narrowly escaped them. They captured one, and
brought him in a prisoner. One of the out-buildings was cleared, and
he was placed in it, under two volunteer guards armed with rifles.
He was not more than twenty-two years old, and had a heavy, stolid
face. He steadily denied that he was a guerrilla, asserting that he
had been in the Rebel army, had deserted from it, taken the oath
of allegiance to the United States while at Knoxville, and was now
trying to live quietly.</p>

<p>Some of Ellis's men believed that he had broken his oath of
allegiance, and was the most obnoxious of the guerrillas. In his
presence they discussed freely the manner of disposing of him. Some
advocated taking him to Knoxville, and turning him over to the
authorities. Others, who seemed to be a majority, urged taking him
out into the orchard and shooting him. This counsel seemed likely to
prevail. Several of the men who gave it had seen brothers or fathers
murdered by the Rebels.</p>

<p>The prisoner had little intelligence, and talked only when
addressed. I could but admire the external stolidity with which
he listened to these discussions. One of his judges and would-be
executioners asked him: </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, sir, what have you to say for yourself?"</p>

<p>"I am in your hands," he replied, without moving a muscle; "you
can kill me if you want to; but I have kept the oath of allegiance,
and I am innocent of the charges you bring against me."</p>

<p>After some further debate, a Union officer from East Tennessee
said.</p>

<p>"He may deserve death, and he probably does. But we are not
murderers, and he shall not be shot. I will use my own revolver on
anybody who attempts it. Let us hear no more of these taunts. No
brave man will insult a prisoner."</p>

<p>It was at last decided to take him to Knoxville. He bore this
decision with the same silence he had manifested at the prospect of
death.</p>

<p>During this scene Dan was absent. He had gone to the nearest Union
house to learn the news, for every loyal family in a range of many
hundred miles knew and loved him. We, very weary, lay down to sleep
in an old orchard, with our saddles for pillows. Our reflections were
pleasant. We were only seventy-nine miles from the Union lines. We
progressed swimmingly, and had even begun to regulate the domestic
affairs of the border!</p>

<div class="sidenote">An Alarm at Midnight.</div>

<p>Before midnight some one shook my arm. I rubbed my eyes open and
looked up. There was Dan Ellis.</p>

<p>"Boys, we must saddle instantly. We have walked right into a nest
of Rebels. Several hundred are within a few miles; eighty are in this
immediate vicinity. They are lying in ambush for Colonel Kirk and
his men. It is doubtful whether we can ever get out of this. We must
divide into two parties. The footmen must take to the mountains; we
who are riding, and in much greater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
danger&mdash;as horses make more noise, and leave so many
traces&mdash;must press on at once, if we ever hope to."</p>

<p>The word was passed in low tones. Our late prisoner, no longer an
object of interest, was allowed to wander away at his own sweet will.
Flinging our saddles upon our weary horses, we were in motion almost
instantly. My place was near the middle of the cavalcade. The man
just before me was riding a white horse, which enabled me to follow
him with ease.</p>

<p>We galloped along at Dan's usual pace, with sublime indifference
to roads&mdash;up and down rocky hills, across streams,
through swamps, over fences&mdash;everywhere but upon public
thoroughfares.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Young Lady for a Guide.</div>

<p>I sup<ins>p</ins>osed we had traveled three miles, when
Davis fell back from the front, and said to me:</p>

<p>"That young lady rides very well, does she not?"</p>

<p>"What young lady?"</p>

<p>"The young lady who is piloting us."</p>

<p>I had thought Dan Ellis was piloting us, and rode forward to see
about the young lady.</p>

<p>There she was! I could not scrutinize her face in the darkness,
but it was said to be comely. I could see that her form was graceful,
and the ease and firmness with which she sat on her horse would have
been a lesson for a riding-master.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Nameless Heroine.</div>

<p>She was a member of the loyal family to which Dan had gone for
news. The moment she learned his need, she volunteered to pilot him
out of that neighborhood, where she was born and bred, and knew every
acre. The only accessible horse (one belonging to a Rebel officer,
but just then kept in her father's barn) was brought out and saddled.
She mounted, came to our camp at midnight, and was now stealthily
guiding us&mdash;avoiding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
farm-houses where the Rebels were quartered, going
round their camps, evading their pickets.</p>

<p>She led us for seven miles. Then, while we remained in the
wood, she rode forward over the long bridge which spanned the
Nolechucky River (now to be crossed a second time), to see if there
were any guards upon it; went to the first Union house beyond, to
learn whether the roads were picketed; came back, and told us the

<div class="sidenote">Among the Delectable Mountains.</div>

<p>Relieved again from immediate danger, every thing seemed like a
blessed dream. I was haunted by the fear of waking to find myself in
the old bunk at Salisbury, with its bare and squalid surroundings.</p>

<p>We were often compelled to walk and lead our weary animals. The
rushing creeks were perilous to cross by night. The rugged mountains
were appalling to our aching limbs and frost-bitten feet. The Union
houses, where we obtained food and counsel, were often humble and
rude. But we had vanquished the Giant Despair, and come up from the
Valley of the Shadow of Death. To our eyes, each icy stream was the
River of Life. The frowning cliffs, with their cruel rocks, were
the very Delectable Mountains; and every friendly log cabin was the
Palace called Beautiful.</p>

<p>After our fair guide left us, Dan's foot was on his native heath.
Familiar with the road, he pressed on like a Fate, without mercy to
man or beast. After the late heavy rains it was now growing intensely
cold. A crust, not yet hard enough to bear, was forming upon the mud,
and at every step our poor horses sunk to the fetlocks.</p>

<p>Even with frequent walking I found it difficult to keep up the
circulation in my own sensitive feet; but the severe admonition of
one frost-bite had taught me to be very cautious. A young North
Carolinian, riding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
a mule, wore nothing upon his feet except a pair of cotton stockings;
that he kept from freezing is one of the unsolved mysteries of human
endurance.</p>

<p>Passing a few miles north of Greenville, at four o'clock in the
morning, we had accomplished twenty-five miles, despite all our
weakness and weariness.</p>

<p>This brought us to Lick Creek, which proved too much swollen
for fording. An old Loyalist, living on the bank, assured us that
guerrillas were numerous and vigilant. Should we never leave them
behind?</p>

<p>Ascending the stream for three miles, we crossed upon the only
bridge in that whole region. Here, at least, our rear was protected;
because, if pursued, we could tear up the planks. Soon after dawn,
upon a hill-side in the pine woods, we dismounted, and huddled around
our fires, a weary, hungry, morose, and melancholy company.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Separation from "Junius."</div>

<p class="quotdate">XXV. <i>Wednesday, January 11.</i></p>

<p>As we drowsed upon the pine leaves, I asked:</p>

<p>"When shall we join the footmen?"</p>

<p>"After we reach Knoxville," was Dan Ellis's reply.</p>

<p>This was a source of uneasiness to Davis and myself, because we
had left "Junius" behind. He was offered a horse when we started, at
midnight. Supposing, like ourselves, that the parties would re-unite
in a few hours, and tired of riding without a saddle, he declined,
and cast his lot among the footmen. It was the first separation since
our capture. Our fates had been so long cast together, that we meant
to keep them united until deliverance should come for one or both,
either through life or death. But Treadaway was an excellent pilot,
and the footmen, able to take paths through the mountains where no
cavalry could follow them, would probably have less difficulty than
we. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Union Women Scrutinizing the Yankee.</div>

<p>I found an old man splitting rails, down in a wooded ravine two
or three hundred yards from our camp. While he went to his house, a
mile distant, to bring me food, I threw myself on the ground beside
his fire and slept like a baby. In an hour, he returned with a
basket containing a great plate of the inevitable bread and pork.
He was accompanied by his wife and daughter, who wanted to look at
the Yankee. Coarse-featured and hard-handed, they were smoking long
pipes; but they were not devoid of womanly tenderness, and earnestly
asked if they could do any thing to help us.</p>

<p>About noon we broke camp, and compelled our half-dead horses to
move on. The road was clearer and safer than we anticipated. At the
first farm which afforded corn, we stopped two or three hours to feed
and rest the poor brutes.</p>

<p>Three of us rode forward to a Union house, and asked for dinner.
The woman, whose husband belonged to the Sixteenth (loyal) Tennessee
Infantry, prepared it at once; but it was an hour before we fully
convinced her that we were not Rebels in disguise.</p>

<p>We passed through Russelville soon after dark, and, two miles
beyond, made a camp in the deep woods. The night was very cold, and
despite the expostulations of Dan Ellis, who feared they belonged to
a Union man, we gathered and fired huge piles of rails, one on either
side of us. Making a bed between them of the soft, fragrant twigs of
the pine, we supped upon burnt corn in the ear. By replenishing our
great fires once an hour we spent the night comfortably.</p>

<p class="quotdate">XXVI. <i>Thursday, January 12.</i></p>

<p>At our farm-house breakfast this morning, a sister of Lieutenant
Treadaway was our hostess. She gave us an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
inviting meal, in which coffee, sugar, and butter, which had long
been only reminiscences to us, were the leading constituents.</p>

<p>By ten we were again upon the road. Two or three of our armed men
kept the advance as scouts, but we now journeyed with comparative
impunity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"Slide Down Off that Horse."</div>

<p>Some of our young men, who had long been hunted by the Rebels,
embraced every possible opportunity of turning the tables. No haste,
weariness, or danger could induce them to omit following the track of
guerrillas, wherever there was reasonable hope of finding the game.
On the road to-day, one of these footmen met a citizen riding a fine
horse.</p>

<p>"What are you, Southerner or Union?" asked the boy, playing with
the hammer of his rifle.</p>

<p>"Well," replied the old Tennesseean, a good deal alarmed, "I have
kept out of the war from the beginning; I have not helped either
side."</p>

<p>"Come! come! That will never do. You don't take me for a fool, do
you? You never could have lived in this country without being either
one thing or the other. Are you Union or Secession?"</p>

<p>"I voted for Secession."</p>

<p>"Tell the entire truth."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I do; I have two sons in Johnson's army. I was an
original Secessionist, and I am as good a Southern man as you can
find in the State of Tennessee."</p>

<p>"All right, my old friend; just slide down off that horse."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that you are just the man I have been looking for, in
walking about a hundred miles&mdash;a good Southerner with a good
horse! I am a Yankee; we are all Yankees; so slide down, and be quick
about it." </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span></p>

<p>Accompanied by the clicking of the rifle, the injunction was not
to be despised. The rider came down, the boy mounted and galloped up
the road, while the old citizen walked slowly homeward, with many a
longing, lingering look behind.</p>

<p>We traveled twenty-five miles to-day, and at night made our camp
in the pine woods near Friend's Station.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Friendly Words but Hostile Eyes.</div>

<p>As the country was now comparatively safe, Davis and myself went
in pursuit of beds. At the first house, two women assured us that
they were good Union people, and very sorry they had not a single
vacant couch. Their words were unexceptionable, but I could not see
the welcome in their eyes. We afterward inquired, and found that they
were violent Rebels.</p>

<p>The next dwelling was a roomy old farm-house, with pleasant and
generous surroundings. In answer to our rap, a white-haired patriarch
of seventy came to the door.</p>

<p>"Can you give us supper and lodging to-night, and breakfast in
the morning? We will pay you liberally, and be greatly obliged
beside."</p>

<p>"I should be glad to entertain you," he replied, in tremulous,
childish treble, "but to-night my daughters are all gone to a frolic.
I have no one in the house except my wife, who, like myself, is old
and feeble."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hospitalities of a Loyal Patriarch.</div>

<p>The lady, impelled by curiosity, now appearing, we repeated the
request to her, with all the suavity and persuasiveness at our
command, for we were hungry and tired, and the place looked inviting.
She dryly gave us the same answer, but began to talk a little.
Presently we again inquired:</p>

<p>"Will you be good enough to accommodate us, or must we look
farther?"</p>

<p>"What are you, anyhow?" </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span></p>

<p>"Union men&mdash;Yankees, escaped from the Salisbury prison."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you say so before? Of course I can give you supper!
Come in, all of you!" The old lady prepared us the most palatable
meal we had yet found, and told us the usual stories of the war. For
hours, by the log fire, we talked with the aged couple, who had three
sons carrying muskets in the Union army, and who loved the Cause
with earnest, enthusiastic devotion. We were no longer apprehensive;
for they assured us that the Rebels had never yet searched their
premises.</p>

<p>In this respect they had been singularly fortunate. Theirs was the
only one among the hundreds of Union houses we entered, which had not
been despoiled by Rebel marauders. More than once the Confederates
had taken from them grain and hay to the value of hundreds of
dollars; but their dwelling had always been respected.</p>

<p class="quotdate">XXVII. <i>Friday, January 13.</i></p>

<p>My poor steed gave signs of approaching dissolution; and I asked
the first man I saw by the roadside:</p>

<p>"Would you like a horse?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, stranger."</p>

<p>"Very well, take this one."</p>

<p>I handed him the bridle, and he led the animal away with a look of
wonder; but it could not have taken him long to comprehend the nature
of my generosity. Several other horses in the party had died or were
left behind as worthless.</p>

<p>Our journey&mdash;originally estimated at two hundred
miles&mdash;had now grown into two hundred and ninety-five by the
roads. In view of our devious windings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
we deemed three hundred and forty miles a very moderate estimate of
the distance we had traveled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"<span class="smcap">Out of the Mouth of
Hell.</span>"</div>

<p>At ten o'clock on the morning of this twenty-seventh day, came
our great deliverance. It was at Strawberry Plains, fifteen miles
east of Knoxville. Here&mdash;after a final march of seven miles,
in which our heavy feet and aching limbs grew wonderfully light
and agile&mdash;in silence, with bowed heads, with full hearts and
with wet eyes, we saluted the Old Flag.<a name="FNanchor_20_20"

      planter named Dixie, who died at some period unknown,
      to the intense grief of his animated property. They
      found expression for their sorrow in song, and consoled
      themselves by clamoring in verse for their removal to
      the land to which Dixie had departed, and where probably
      the renewed spirit would be greatly surprised to find
      himself in their company. Whether they were ill treated
      after he died, and thus had reason to deplore his removal,
      or merely desired heaven in the abstract, nothing known
      enables me to assert. But Dixie's Land is now generally

      he was suddenly arrested, robbed, and imprisoned in a

      of contrasting the resources of the two sections, and demonstrating
      therefrom, with mathematical precision, that the war could not
      last long; that the superiority of the North in men and money would
      make the subjugation of the South a short and easy task.

      Upon our frontier it is used, colloquially, as a verb, to
      signify surrounded, captured, completely in the power, or
      at the mercy, of another.

      <span class="label">11</span></a> Through severest trials, and
      cruel neglect from our Government, they never swerved a
      hair's-breadth. Before our troops opened East Tennessee, enough
      left their homes, coming stealthily through the mountains and
      enlisting in the Union army, to make sixteen regiments.

      <span class="label">12</span></a> The leniency of the
      Government toward these men was remarkable. For many months
      after the war began, Breckinridge, in the United States
      Senate, and Burnett, in the House of Representatives,
      uttered defiant treason, for which they were not only
      pardoned, but paid by the Government they were attempting
      to overthrow. As late as August, 1861, after Bull Run,
      after Wilson Creek, Buckner visited Washington, was allowed
      to inspect the fortifications, and went almost directly
      thence to Richmond. When he next returned to Kentucky, it
      was at the head of an invading Rebel army.

      Missourian, deemed trustworthy, and thoroughly familiar with the
      country. He reported officially to Fremont that the whole Rebel army
      was within eleven miles of us, when it was really fifty miles away.
      Then, indeed, much later in the war, accurate information about the
      enemy seemed absolutely unattainable. Scott, McClellan, Halleck,
      Grant, all failed to procure it. Rosecrans was the first general who
      kept himself thoroughly advised of the whereabouts, strength, and
      designs of the Rebels.

       Our Government, upon learning of this, ordered the
       commandant at Fortress Monroe, the moment he should
       learn, officially or otherwise, that Sawyer and Flynn
       had been executed, to shoot in retaliation two Rebel
       officers&mdash;sons of Generals Lee and Winder. On the
       reception of this news in the Richmond papers at daylight
       one morning, the prisoners cheered and shouted with
       delight. As they supposed, that settled the question.
       Nothing more was heard about executing our officers; and
       soon after, Sawyer and Flynn were exchanged, months before
       their less fortunate comrades.

      Captain Thomas, in the character of a French lady, took
      passage on the steamer at Baltimore, with several followers
      disguised as mechanics. Near Point Lookout they overpowered
      the crew and captured the vessel, converting her into
      a privateer. Afterward, while attempting to repeat the
      enterprise, they were made prisoners.
